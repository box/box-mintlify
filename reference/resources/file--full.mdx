<Info>
This resource has a few variations that can be encountered when
using the API.

The fields that are part of the **full** variant can be returned
by API endpoints that support the `fields` parameter. For example,
by defining the `fields` request parameter as
`id,type` when requesting a file by ID, only those fields will
be returned in the API response.

      Make sure to make an authenticated API call to this endpoint.
      
      This URL is a template and will require the `{+asset_path}` to

      it can be replaced by an empty string.
      
      For paged representations, replace the `{+asset_path}` with the

        `Content-Disposition` header in the API response with the

that has been applied to this item.

This can be used in combination with the `GET /events`-endpoint

identifier was read.

An example would be where a Box Drive-like application
would fetch an item via the API, and then listen to incoming
user events for changes to the item. The application would
ignore any user events where the `sequence_id` in the event
is smaller than or equal to the `sequence_id` in the originally
fetched resource.
