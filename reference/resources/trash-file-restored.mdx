that has been applied to this item.

This can be used in combination with the `GET /events`-endpoint
to filter out user events that would have occurred before this
identifier was read.

An example would be where a Box Drive-like application
would fetch an item via the API, and then listen to incoming
user events for changes to the item. The application would
ignore any user events where the `sequence_id` in the event
is smaller than or equal to the `sequence_id` in the originally
fetched resource.

of a file on Box with a local file.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="shared_link" type="string">
The shared link for this file. This will
be `null` if a file had been trashed, even though the original shared
link does become active again.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="size" type="integer">
example: `629644`

The file size in bytes. Be careful parsing this integer as it can
get very large and cause an integer overflow.
</ParamField>
