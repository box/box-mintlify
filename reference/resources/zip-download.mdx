Represents a successful request to create a `zip` archive of a list of files
and folders.

<ParamField body="download_url" type="string">
example: `https://dl.boxcloud.com/2.0/zip_downloads/Lu6fA9Ob-jyysp3AAvMF4AkLEwZwAYbL=tgj2zIC=eK9RvJnJbjJl9rNh2qBgHDpyOCAOhpM=vajg2mKq8Mdd/content`

The URL that can be used to download the `zip` archive. A `Get` request to
this URL will start streaming the items requested. By default, this URL
is only valid for a few seconds, until the `expires_at` time, unless a
download is started after which it is valid for the duration of the
download.

It is important to note that the domain and path of this URL might change
between API calls, and therefore it's important to use this URL as-is.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="expires_at" type="string(date-time)">
example: `2019-08-29T23:59:00-07:00`

The time and date when this archive will expire. After this time the
`status_url` and `download_url` will return an error.

By default, these URLs are only valid for a few seconds, unless a download
is started after which the `download_url` is valid for the duration of the
download, and the `status_url` is valid for 12 hours from the start of the
download.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="name_conflicts" type="arrayarray">
A list of conflicts that occurred when trying to create the archive. This
would occur when multiple items have been requested with the
same name.

To solve these conflicts, the API will automatically rename an item
and return a mapping between the original item's name and its new
name.

For every conflict, both files will be renamed and therefore this list
will always be a multiple of 2.

<Expandable>
  <ParamField body="[]" type="object[]">
  An individual conflict that occurred when trying to create the archive.
  This includes an array of 2 objects, each containing the original name
  and the renamed filename of a file or folder for which the names
  conflicted.
  
  <Expandable>
    <ParamField body="id" type="string">
    example: `12345`
    
    The identifier of the item.
    </ParamField>
  
    <ParamField body="type" type="string">
    example: `file`
    
    The type of this item.
    
    Value is one of `file`,`folder`
    </ParamField>
  
    <ParamField body="download_name" type="string">
    example: `3aa6a7.pdf`
    
    The new name of this item as it will appear in the
    downloaded `zip` archive.
    </ParamField>
  
    <ParamField body="original_name" type="string">
    example: `Report.pdf`
    
    Box Developer Documentation.

<ParamField body="status_url" type="string">
example: `https://api.box.com/2.0/zip_downloads/Lu6fA9Ob-jyysp3AAvMF4AkLEwZwAYbL=tgj2zIC=eK9RvJnJbjJl9rNh2qBgHDpyOCAOhpM=vajg2mKq8Mdd/status`

The URL that can be used to get the status of the `zip` archive being
downloaded. A `Get` request to this URL will return the number of files
in the archive as well as the number of items already downloaded or
skipped. By default, this URL is only valid for a few seconds, until the
`expires_at` time, unless a download is started after which the URL is
valid for 12 hours from the start of the download.

It is important to note that the domain and path of this URL might change
between API calls, and therefore it's important to use this URL as-is.
