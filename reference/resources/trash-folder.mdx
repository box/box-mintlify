An example would be where a Box Drive-like application
would fetch an item via the API, and then listen to incoming
user events for changes to the item. The application would
ignore any user events where the `sequence_id` in the event
is smaller than or equal to the `sequence_id` in the originally

Be careful parsing this integer as its
value can get very large.

example: `2012-12-12T10:53:43-08:00`
