A retention policy blocks permanent deletion of content
for a specified amount of time. Admins can create retention
policies and then later assign them to specific folders, metadata
templates, or their entire enterprise. To use this feature, you must
have the manage retention policies scope enabled
for your API key via your application management console.

  only in a limited way: add a folder, lengthen the duration,
  retire the policy, change the disposition action
