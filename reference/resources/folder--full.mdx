API version 2024.0



A full representation of a folder, as can be returned from any
folder API endpoints by default.

* [Full](/reference/resources/folder--full/)
* [Standard](/reference/resources/folder/)
* [Mini](/reference/resources/folder--mini/)

This resource has a few variations that can be encountered when

The fields that are part of the **full** variant can be returned

by defining the `fields` request parameter as
`id,type` when requesting a file by ID, only those fields will
be returned in the API response.
