This resource has a few variations that can be encountered when
using the API.

The fields that are part of the **full** variant can be returned
by API endpoints that support the `fields` parameter. For example,
by defining the `fields` request parameter as
`id,type` when requesting a file by ID, only those fields will
be returned in the API response.
