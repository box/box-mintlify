This can be used in combination with the `GET /events`-endpoint
to filter out user events that would have occurred before this
identifier was read.

An example would be where a Box Drive-like application
would fetch an item via the API, and then listen to incoming
user events for changes to the item. The application would
ignore any user events where the `sequence_id` in the event
is smaller than or equal to the `sequence_id` in the originally
fetched resource.

link does become active again.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="size" type="integer(int64)">
example: `629644`

The folder size in bytes.

Be careful parsing this integer as its
value can get very large.

<ParamField body="trashed_at" type="string">
The time at which this folder was put in the
trash - becomes `null` after restore.
