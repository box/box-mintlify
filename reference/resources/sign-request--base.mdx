<Info>
This resource has a few variations that can be encountered when
using the API.

The fields that are part of the **base** variant represent
the default fields that are always returned when using the `fields`
query parameter, additional to the fields specified in the
parameter.
</Info>

<ParamField body="are_reminders_enabled" type="boolean">
example: `true`

Reminds signers to sign a document on day 3, 8, 13 and 18. Reminders are only sent to outstanding signers.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="are_text_signatures_enabled" type="boolean">
example: `true`

Disables the usage of signatures generated by typing (text).
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="days_valid" type="integer">
example: `2`

Set the number of days after which the created signature request will automatically expire if not completed. By default, we do not apply any expiration date on signature requests, and the signature request does not expire.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="declined_redirect_url" type="string">
example: `https://declined-redirect.com`

The uri that a signer will be redirected to after declining to sign a document.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="email_message" type="string">
example: `Hello! Please sign the document below`

Message to include in sign request email. The field is cleaned through sanitization of specific characters. However, some html tags are allowed. Links included in the message are also converted to hyperlinks in the email. The message may contain the following html tags including `a`, `abbr`, `acronym`, `b`, `blockquote`, `code`, `em`, `i`, `ul`, `li`, `ol`, and `strong`. Be aware that when the text to html ratio is too high, the email may end up in spam filters. Custom styles on these tags are not allowed. If this field is not passed, a default message will be used.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="email_subject" type="string">
example: `Sign Request from Acme`

Subject of sign request email. This is cleaned by sign request. If this field is not passed, a default subject will be used.

</ParamField>

<ParamField body="external_system_name" type="string">

example: `name`

Name of the signature request.

<ParamField body="parent_folder" type="Folder (Mini)object">
The destination folder to place final, signed document and signing
log. Only `ID` and `type` fields are required. The root folder,
folder ID `0`, cannot be used and can also not be null.

When this value is not passed in when the signature request, then
we will use a default folder which is either the parent folder of
the first source file in the payload if we have the permission to
upload to that folder or a folder called "My Sign Requests".
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="prefill_tags" type="object[]">

</ParamField>

<ParamField body="signers" type="object[]">
Array of signers for the signature request. 35 is the
max number of signers permitted.

**Note**: It may happen that some signers belong to conflicting [segments](/reference/resources/shield-information-barrier-segment-member/) (user groups).
This means that due to the security policies, users are assigned to segments to prevent exchanges or communication that could lead to ethical conflicts.
In such a case, an attempt to send the sign request will result in an error.

  If set, signers who have the same value will be assigned to the same input and to the same signer group.
  A signer group is not a Box Group. It is an entity that belongs to a Sign Request and can only be
  used/accessed within this Sign Request. A signer group is expected to have more than one signer.
  If the provided value is only used for one signer, this value will be ignored and request will be handled
  as it was intended for an individual signer. The value provided can be any string and only used to
  determine which signers belongs to same group. A successful response will provide a generated UUID value
  instead for signers in the same signer group.

  Cannot be selected in combination with `login_required`.
  </ParamField>

</Expandable>
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="source_files" type="File (Base)array">

example: `123075213-af2c8822-3ef2-4952-8557-52d69c2fe9cb`

When a signature request is created from a template this field will indicate the id of that template.
