API version 2024.0



Web links are objects that point to URLs. These objects
are also known as bookmarks within the Box web application.

Web link objects are treated similarly to file objects,
they will also support most actions that apply to regular files.

* [Standard](/reference/resources/web-link/)
* [Mini](/reference/resources/web-link--mini/)
* [Base](/reference/resources/web-link--base/)

<Info>
This resource has a few variations that can be encountered when
using the API.

The fields that are part of the **standard** variant are generally
returned when the resource is requested via its own API endpoints.
For example, when retrieving a file by ID, it will return
these fields unless the `fields` parameter has been specified.

An example would be where a Box Drive-like application
would fetch an item via the API, and then listen to incoming

ignore any user events where the `sequence_id` in the event
is smaller than or equal to the `sequence_id` in the originally
