AI LLM endpoint params AWS object.

<ParamField body="type" type="string">
example: `aws_params`

The type of the AI LLM endpoint params object for AWS.
This parameter is **required**.

Value is always `aws_params`
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="temperature" type="number">
example: `0.5`

What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 1. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random,
while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic.
We generally recommend altering this or `top_p` but not both.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="top_p" type="number">
example: `0.5`

An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results
of the tokens with `top_p` probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability
mass are considered. We generally recommend altering this or temperature but not both.
