<Info>
This resource has a few variations that can be encountered when
using the API.

The fields that are part of the **mini** variant are generally
returned when the resource is nested within the response for
another resource.
</Info>

<ParamField body="id" type="string">
example: `12345`

The unique identifier that represent a file.

The ID for any file can be determined
by visiting a file in the web application
and copying the ID from the URL. For example,
for the URL `https://*.app.box.com/files/123`
the `file_id` is `123`.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="type" type="string">
example: `file`

The value will always be `file`.

Value is always `file`
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="etag" type="string">
example: `1`

The HTTP `etag` of this file. This can be used within some API
endpoints in the `If-Match` and `If-None-Match` headers to only
perform changes on the file if (no) changes have happened.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="file_version" type="File version (Mini)object">
A mini representation of a file version, used when
nested within another resource.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="name" type="string">
example: `Contract.pdf`

The name of the file.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="sequence_id" type="string">
example: `3`

A numeric identifier that represents the most recent user event
that has been applied to this item.

This can be used in combination with the `GET /events`-endpoint
to filter out user events that would have occurred before this
identifier was read.

An example would be where a Box Drive-like application
would fetch an item via the API, and then listen to incoming
user events for changes to the item. The application would
ignore any user events where the `sequence_id` in the event
is smaller than or equal to the `sequence_id` in the originally
fetched resource.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="sha1" type="string(digest)">
example: `85136C79CBF9FE36BB9D05D0639C70C265C18D37`

The SHA1 hash of the file.
</ParamField>
