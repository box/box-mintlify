Web link objects are treated similarly to file objects,
they will also support most actions that apply to regular files.

This resource has a few variations that can be encountered when
using the API.

The fields that are part of the **mini** variant are generally
returned when the resource is nested within the response for
another resource.

<ParamField body="id" type="string">
example: `11446498`

The unique identifier for this web link.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="type" type="string">
example: `web_link`

The value will always be `web_link`.

Value is always `web_link`
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="etag" type="string">
example: `1`

The entity tag of this web link. Used with `If-Match`
headers.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="name" type="string">
example: `My Bookmark`

The name of the web link.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="sequence_id" type="string">
example: `3`

A numeric identifier that represents the most recent user event
that has been applied to this item.

This can be used in combination with the `GET /events`-endpoint
to filter out user events that would have occurred before this
identifier was read.

An example would be where a Box Drive-like application
would fetch an item via the API, and then listen to incoming
user events for changes to the item. The application would
ignore any user events where the `sequence_id` in the event
is smaller than or equal to the `sequence_id` in the originally
fetched resource.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="url" type="string">
example: `https://www.example.com/example/1234`

The URL this web link points to.
</ParamField>
