AI LLM endpoint params OpenAI object.

<ParamField body="type" type="string">
example: `openai_params`

The type of the AI LLM endpoint params object for OpenAI.
This parameter is **required**.

Value is always `openai_params`
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="frequency_penalty" type="number">
example: `1.5`

A number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on their existing frequency in the
text so far, decreasing the model's likelihood to repeat the same line verbatim.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="presence_penalty" type="number">
example: `1.5`

A number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to talk about new topics.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="stop" type="string">
example: `<|im_end|>`

Up to 4 sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="temperature" type="number">
example: `0`

What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random,
while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic.
We generally recommend altering this or `top_p` but not both.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="top_p" type="number">
example: `1`

An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results
of the tokens with `top_p` probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability
mass are considered. We generally recommend altering this or temperature but not both.
