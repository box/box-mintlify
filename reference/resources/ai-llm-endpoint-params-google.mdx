AI LLM endpoint params Google object.

<ParamField body="type" type="string">
example: `google_params`

The type of the AI LLM endpoint params object for Google.
This parameter is **required**.

Value is always `google_params`
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="temperature" type="number">
example: `0`

The temperature is used for sampling during response generation, which occurs when `top-P` and `top-K` are applied. Temperature controls the degree of randomness in the token selection.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="top_k" type="number">
example: `1`

`Top-K` changes how the model selects tokens for output. A low `top-K` means the next selected token is
the most probable among all tokens in the model's vocabulary (also called greedy decoding),
while a high `top-K` means that the next token is selected from among the three most probable tokens by using temperature.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="top_p" type="number">
example: `1`

`Top-P` changes how the model selects tokens for output. Tokens are selected from the most (see `top-K`) to least probable until the sum of their probabilities equals the `top-P` value.
</ParamField>
