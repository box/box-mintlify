To create an upload session, call the
<Link href="/reference/post_files_upload_sessions">`POST /files/upload_sessions`</Link> API with the desired `file_name`
and `folder_id` to put the file in, as well as the `file_size` of the file to be
uploaded.

{/* <Samples sample='post_files_upload_sessions' /> */}

To create a session for a new version of an existing file, call the
<Link href="/reference/post_files_id_upload_sessions">`POST /files/:id/upload_sessions`</Link> API instead. In this
case, the `file_name` and `folder_id` are only required when renaming or moving
the file in the process.

{/* <Samples sample='post_files_id_upload_sessions' /> */}

## Pre-flight Check

Creating an upload session also performs a <Link href="/guides/uploads/check">preflight check</Link>, making it
unnecessary to do so separately when working with chunked uploads.

## Response

When a session is created successfully the response includes an <Link href="/reference/resources/upload_session">Upload
Session</Link> that includes a session ID, the number of parts, the
part sizes, as well as links to the relevant next API endpoints to use.

The upload session defines the size of the parts to use when uploading the
individual parts.
