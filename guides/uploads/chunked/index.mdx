The Chunked Upload API provides a way to reliably upload large files to Box by
chunking them into a sequence of parts that can be uploaded individually.

{/* alex ignore failed */}
By using this API the application uploads a file in part, allowing it to recover
from a failed request more reliably. It means an application only needs to
retry the upload of a single part instead of the entire file.

An additional benefit of chunked uploads is that parts can be uploaded
in parallel, allowing for a potential performance improvement.

## Overview

Chunked uploads require a sequence of API calls to be made.

1. **<Link href="/guides/uploads/chunked/create-session">Create an upload session</Link>**: The application creates an upload session for a new file or new version of a file. The session defines the (new) name  of the file, its size, and the parent folder.
2. **<Link href="/guides/uploads/chunked/upload-part">Upload parts</Link>**: The application uploads the separate parts of the file as chunks.
3. **<Link href="/guides/uploads/chunked/commit-session">Commit session</Link>**: The application commits the session, at which moment the integrity of the file is checked before it is placed in the location specified when the session was created.

  Most of <Link href="/guides/uploads/chunked/with-sdks">the Box SDKs support chunked uploads</Link> out of the Box, removing
  the complexity from the application code.

## Restrictions

The Chunked Upload API is intended for large files with a minimum size of 20MB.
The API does not support uploads of files with a size smaller than this.

This API does not support re-uploading or overwriting of parts in a session.
Once a part has been uploaded, it is immutable.

The lifetime of an upload session is 7 days. During this time, the client can
upload parts at their own pace.

{/* alex ignore corruption */}
To avoid wasting resources, and avoid potential data corruption, client should
make sure that the underlying file has not been changed on disk since beginning
the upload.
