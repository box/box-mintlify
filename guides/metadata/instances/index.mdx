import {Link} from "/snippets/Link.jsx";

A <Link href="/guides/metadata/instances">metadata instance</Link> describes the relation between
a <Link href="/guides/metadata/templates">metadata template</Link> and a file or folder. It includes the values
that are assigned for every field of the template.

For example, a user might have assigned an `invoiceData` metadata template to a
file and provided 2 values, one for the invoice ID and one for the customer ID.

You can assign up to 100 templates to specific file or folder.
