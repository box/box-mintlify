A metadata query provides a way to find files and
folders by searching for the metadata attached to them.

For example, to find the all files for an invoice with a certain ID, the query
would look for all files and folders with the `invoiceData` template attached to
it and a value of `id = :id`, where `:id` would be the value of the invoice.

## Authentication

The metadata query API can be used by applications that have been authenticated
using traditional <Link href="/guides/authentication/oauth2">OAuth 2.0</Link> or <Link href="/guides/authentication/jwt">JWT</Link>.
