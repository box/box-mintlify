A metadata taxonomy enables Box admins to define metadata hierarchies, as well as:

- Add multi-level metadata to a file or folder

- Define terms that form available taxonomy options

- Reuse a taxonomy in multiple metadata templates

Taxonomies can help admins organize and manage their company's metadata structures. An example of a 5-level taxonomy could include the categories of Region, Country, State, County, and City.

A taxonomy can have a depth of up to 10 levels.
