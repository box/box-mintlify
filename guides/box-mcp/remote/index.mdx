title: "Remote Box MCP server"
---
[Remote Box MCP server](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) is a standardized way for AI Agents to connect and interact with third-party applications like Box, enabling seamless access to content and AI capabilities across platforms. The Box MCP server acts as a bridge that allows leading AI Agent platforms — such as Copilot Studio, Claude Enterprise, Mistral Le Chat — to securely query and utilize Box data and AI-powered tools without exposing raw file content. Through OAuth authorization, users can grant AI Agents controlled access to their Box accounts, enabling intelligent document handling, advanced search, and multi-file AI queries directly within these external AI environments.

## Access and manage predefined Box MCP servers

1. Click **Integrations** in the sidebar of Box Admin Console. 
2. Use *Categories* filter and choose MCP or search for a predefined Box MCP server in the search field search at the top of the window.
3. Beside the selected MCP server, click the state, then select the state you want to enable.

## Add Box MCP server on the Client Side

Exact steps for adding Box MCP server may vary depending on the AI platform. Refer to your platform’s documentation for client-side setup instructions. Check this sample code for reference:

To connect to Box from the AI Agent platform, you need to:

* Add endpoint URL: `https://mcp.box.com`
* Pass client ID and client secret. Box generates these in the Integration Credentials section of your Admin Console when configuring the Box MCP server, above.
* Pass an MCP name: `box-remote-mcp`
* Provide an `authorization_token`

```python
  response = await client.beta.messages.create(
      model="claude-3-opus-20240229",  # Or your preferred model
      max_tokens=4096,
      messages=conversation_history,
      mcp_servers=[
          {
              "type": "url",
              "url": "https://mcp.box.com",
              "name": "box-remote-mcp",
              "authorization_token": BEARER_TOKEN,
          }
      ],
      betas=["mcp-client-2025-04-04"]
  )
```

### ChatGPT

To add the remote Box MCP server in ChatGPT, follow these steps:

1. Go to **Box** > **Admin Console** > **Integrations** and find **Box MCP Server** - either by using the MCP Category filter, or by using the search bar at the top of the page.  
2. Go to **Configuration**. 
3. Click the **Add Integration Credentials** button to generate new credentials. 
4. In **Redirect URIs**, change the Box redirect URIs to: https://chatgpt.com/connector_platform_oauth_redirect

  The **Client ID** and **Client Secret** are displayed. These will be required later for ChatGPT to make the authorization connection. 

5. Check the **Access** scopes: 
      * Read all files and folders stored in Box. 
      * Read and write all files and folders stored in Box. 
      * Manage AI Requests. 
6. Click **Save**. 
7. On the ChatGPT side, as a ChatGPT Workspace admin, click the profile in the bottom-left corner. 
8. Click **Settings** > **Apps & Connectors** > **Advanced Settings**. 
9. Toggle the **Developer mode** on. 
This enables you to add custom connectors. 
10. Go back to **Apps & Connectors**. 
11. Click **Create** at the top-right corner of the modal. 
12. Fill in the data: 
      * **Name**: For example, `Box MCP Server Connector`. 
      * **MCP Server URL**: https://mcp.box.com
      * **OAuth Client ID**: Found in Box **Admin Console** > **Integrations** > **Box MCP Server** > **Configuration**. 
      * **OAuth Client Secret**: Found in Box **Admin Console** > **Integrations** > **Box MCP Server** > **Configuration**. 
13. Select the `I understand and want to continue` checkbox and click **Create**. 
14. Authorize the Box user. 

<Note>
  If an error displays, such as `Something went wrong with setting up the connection`, you can continue to click through. The setup should work even if this displays. 
</Note>

15. Test the setup by going to the chat, clicking the **+** icon, then hovering over **More** and selecting the newly added connector. Make sure that the other, built by OpenAI Box connector, is turned off or disconnected, so the answer is provided by the custom connector. 
16. If you want to add this connector for the whole workspace, you can publish it within [ChatGPT Workspace](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/12584461-developer-mode-and-full-mcp-connectors-in-chatgpt-beta#:~:text=Publish%20connector,settings%20in%20ChatGPT).
