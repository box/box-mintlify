Server authentication applications using <Link href="/guides/authentication/jwt">JWT</Link> or
<Link href="/guides/authentication/client-credentials">Client Credentials Grant</Link> must be authorized by a Box Admin before use.

Unpublished applications using <Link href="/guides/authentication/oauth2">OAuth 2.0</Link> authentication may
require enablement by a Box Admin if they are <Link href="/guides/security/#enterprise-settings-and-authorization">inactive by default</Link>.

A Box Admin needs an application's Client ID in order to properly
authorize or enable it in the Admin Console.

<Info>
You can use <Link href="/guides/applications">My Platform Apps</Link> view to quickly look up
the authorization and enablement status of your application.
</Info>

## Approval Notifications

A semi-automated process to submit an app approval is available in the Developer
Console for all platform application types.

### Server authentication apps

Navigate to the **Authorization** tab for your application in the
[Developer Console][devconsole].

</Frame>

### User authentication apps

Navigate to the **Enablement** tab for your application in the [Developer Console][devconsole].

</Frame>

Submitting the application for approval will send an email to your
enterprise's Primary Admin to approve the application.
When a Box Admin approves or declines your request,
you will get an email with the decision.
More information on this process is available in our [support article on app authorization][app-auth].

## Manual Approval

The following steps provide instructions on how to manually approve the
application.

### As a developer

1. Navigate to the **Configuration** tab for your application in the [Developer Console][devconsole].
2. Scroll down to the OAuth 2.0 Credentials section and copy the **Client ID** value to provide to a Box Admin.

Alternatively, hover over the application in the
<Link href="/guides/applications">My Platform Apps</Link> view to look up the **ClientID** and then
copy it using the `copy` button.

<Info>
  **Finding a Box Admin**

  If you don't know your enterprise Admin, go to your Box [Account
  Settings][settings] page and scroll to the bottom. If an admin contact is set
  you should see their contact information under "Admin Contact".
</Info>

### As an Admin

1. Navigate to the [Admin Console][adminconsole] and select the **Apps** tab (1) from the left navigation panel.
2. Click the **Platform Apps Manager** tab (2) at the top of your screen.
3. For both Server and User Authentication Apps screens, click the **Add App** (3) button in the top right corner to add a new app.
4. Alternatively, you can use the Platform Apps Manager table menu (4) to authorize and enable apps.

#### Server Authentication Apps

#### User Authentication Apps

</Frame>

In the popup that appears, enter the client ID for the application that the
developer collected from the **Configuration** tab of the
[Developer Console][devconsole].

## Re-authorization on changes

When the application's scopes or access level change the application needs to be
re-authorized. Repeat the process above and request a new Access Token for the
new changes to take effect.

In the same section where the application was initially authorized, an Admin
can re-authorize the application by clicking on the ellipses to the right
of the application name to **Reauthorize App**.
