operate.

There are two options here:

* **All content in your company** authorizes the Skill at the root folder of every user. This results in every file uploaded to any folder being processed by the Box Skill application.
* **Select a list of folders** enables the application to a specific folder or set of folders on which the Skill application operates.

Click "Enable Skill" and accept the terms and agreements. The Custom Skill is
now enabled. Any new content added to the selected folder(s) will now trigger an
event to be sent to the Invocation URL configured in the Box
[Developer Console][devconsole].

<Info>

  There is a limit of 10 enabled Skills per enterprise at any given time. Please
