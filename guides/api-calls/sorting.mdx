Where an API returns a collection of items it often supports sorting of API
responses.

Use the `sort` and `direction` query parameters to sort the collection either in
ascending or descending order.

```sh
curl https://api.box.com/2.0/folders/0/items?sort=size&direction=DESC \
    -H "authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

<Warning>
  Not all API endpoints that return collections have support for sorting.
  Especially endpoints that use marker-based pagination often lack support for
  sorting the results.
</Warning>

## Sorting criteria

The field to sort on is defined by the `sort` query parameter. Check the API
endpoint's documentation for the possible options for this value.

<Note>
  In some APIs the `sort` field is the second criteria by which the items are
  sorted. For example for the <Link href="/reference/get-folders-id-items">`GET /folders/:id/items`</Link>
  endpoint the results are always sorted by their type first before any other
  criteria.
</Note>

## Sorting direction

The sorting direction supports two values, either `ASC` for ascending order, or
`DESC` for the reverse.
