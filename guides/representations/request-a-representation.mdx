To select a specific representation call the <Link href="/reference/get-files-id">`GET /files/:id`</Link>
endpoint with a <Link href="/reference/get-files-id#param-x-rep-hints">`x-rep-hints`</Link>-header defining the
required representation format.

```sh
curl https://api.box.com/2.0/files/123?fields=representations \
    -H "x-rep-hints: [pdf]" \
    -H "authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

## Multiple dimensions

Some formats will require the `dimensions` to be passed in to select a
specific size. This can be achieved by appending the `dimensions` to the
header.

```sh
curl https://api.box.com/2.0/files/123?fields=representations \
    -H "x-rep-hints: [jpg?dimensions=94x94]" \
    -H "authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

## Multiple representations

Multiple representations can be fetched by chaining the different
types in the `x-rep-hints`-header.

```sh
curl https://api.box.com/2.0/files/123?fields=representations \
    -H "x-rep-hints: [pdf][jpg?dimensions=94x94]" \
    -H "authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

## API Response

This API call will result in one or more representations with a `url_template`
value that includes a `{+asset_path}` value.

```json
{
  "etag": "1",
  "id": "123",
  "representations": {
    "entries": [
      {
        "content": {
          "url_template": "https://dl.boxcloud.com/api/2.0/internal_files/123/versions/345/representations/pdf/content/{+asset_path}"
        },
        "info": {
          "url": "https://api.box.com/2.0/internal_files/123/versions/345/representations/pdf"
        },
        "properties": {},
        "representation": "pdf",
        "status": {
          "state": "success"
        }
      }
    ]
  },
  "type": "file"
}
```

<Note>
  The `url_template` in this response is an **opaque** URL. This URL format
  might change over time and no assumptions should be made about its format
  except for the presence of the `{+asset_path}` variable.
