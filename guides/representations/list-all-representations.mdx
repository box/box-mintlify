To see what representations are available for a file you can call the
<Link href="/reference/get-files-id">`GET /files/:id`</Link> endpoint while requesting the
<Link href="/reference/resources/file#param-representations">`representations`</Link> field.

```sh
curl https://api.box.com/2.0/files/123?fields=representations \
    -H "authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

The response will include a list of representations in the following format

```json
...
{
  "info": {
    "url": "https://api.box.com/2.0/internal_files/123/versions/345/representations/jpg_thumb_32x32"
  },
  "properties": {
      "dimensions": "32x32",
      "paged": "false",
      "thumb": "true"
  },
  "representation": "jpg"

```

## Response fields

Every representation will include a set of properties and the type of
representation.

* The optional `dimensions` field represents the file's dimensions in pixels as width by height.

* The optional `paged` field specifies if this representation is a paged document. Some images and PDFs will often be paged documents.

* The optional `thumb` field specifies if this representation is suitable as a file thumbnail.
