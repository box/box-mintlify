A text representation provides a way to extract plain text
from a document.

Text is generated for all document file types including plain text and
code files supported by Box. This does not include image files as these
do not have a text layer.

Text representations are generated upon upload of the file, similarly to PDFs
and thumbnails. They are not generated for files larger than 500
megabytes.

## The process

To get a text representation follow the following steps

- <Link href="/guides/representations/list-all-representations">List all representations</Link>
- <Link href="/guides/representations/request-a-representation">Request a text representation</Link> by passing the `x-rep-hints`-header with the value `[extracted_text]`.
- <Link href="/guides/representations/download-a-representation">Download the text</Link> by calling the `url_template`, replacing the `{+asset_path}` with an empty string.
