Currently, the API only allows the creation of new file requests by copying an
existing file request associated to another folder. Please check our below
guide on creating a template folder with a template file request.

## 1. Template folder

First off, create a template folder that you can associate the template file
request to. This can be any folder really, but we recommend using a
folder that is only used for this purpose.

A folder can be created through the Box web or mobile interface, or through the
<Link href="/reference/post-folders">`POST /folders`</Link> API.

<Note>

When using server-side JWT authentication, we recommend creating folder that
is owned by the application's
<Link href="/platform/user-types/#service-account">Service Account</Link>. This way,
the folder can't be accidentally deleted by a regular Box user.

</Note>

## 2. Template file request

To create a file request, navigate to the template folder in the web app an
d click the 3 dots at the top of the page. Then, select **File Request** from
the menu.

</Frame>

In the next configuration panel, click the **Edit** button to visit the file
request configuration page.

![Edit a file request](/images/guides/file-requests/edit.png)

</Frame>

On the configuration page, you can set configure the title and description,
before saving the page.

This page will also have the ID of the file request in the URL. Make a note of
the URL as the number at the end is the file request's ID, which you will need
when working with the API.

```sh
https://*.app.box.com/filerequest/2338423584
```

<Warning>

If your template folder belongs to a JWT user, you will need to
<Link href="/reference/post-collaborations">invite</Link> a managed Box user to the folder before
it can be seen in the web app. Invite yourself to the folder to allow yourself
to add a file request to the folder via the app.

</Warning>

## 3. Using a template

A template file request can be used to create new copies using the
<Link href="/reference/post-file-requests-id-copy">`POST /file-requests/:id/copy`</Link>
API. With the ID of a new folder in hand, you can copy the existing
request, including its title, description and form-configuration
to a new folder <Link href="/guides/file-requests/copy">with one API call</Link>.
