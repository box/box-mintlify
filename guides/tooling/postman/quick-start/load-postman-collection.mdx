  Now that you are logged in you can fork the **Box Postman Collection** into the
  **Postman App** that was installed previously. When you fork the Postman
  Collection you will need to load your API credentials in the Postman
  environment. More details are available in [Postman Authorization guides][authorization]. 

  ## Forking a collection and environment

  By clicking the button below you will fork the **Box Postman
  Collection** into your Postman application. Load in the **Access Token**, **Refresh Token**, **Client ID** and **Client
  Secret** into your Postman environment via the [environment selector][environment].

  <Trigger option='postman_collection_downloaded' value='true'>
    <Postman env='postman_credentials' />
  </Trigger>

  It is recommended to fork the Box Postman Collection - you will be asked if you 
  want to update the collection any time Box makes changes to it. You can also
  copy the collection, but you might miss important updates.

collection into the Postman application. Once imported, the collection should
appear within the app in the left-hand sidebar.
