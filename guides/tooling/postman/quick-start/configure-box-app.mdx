To use the **Postman Collection** the Postman application needs to authenticate
to the Box API using an **Access Token**. The simplest way to get an Access
Token is by logging into Box using a **Box App**.

A **Box App** is an application that can be used for making API calls. When
using the **Postman Collection** you can choose to either set up your own Box
App or use our preconfigured one. The key benefit of setting up your own Box App
is that you won't need to go through login every hour, but it does require a few
extra steps to set up.

## Select a Box App to use

<Grid columns='2'>
  <Choose option='postman.app_type' value='create_new' color='blue'>
    # Create new Box App

    Follow this process if you haven't already created a Box App, or want to create an additional one.  
  </Choose>

  <Choose option='postman.app_type' value='use_existing' color='blue'>
    # Use existing Box app

    If you've already created a Box App that you want to use, then we can use the credentials for that application. 
  </Choose>
</Grid>

<Choice option='postman.app_type' value='create_new,clicked' color='blue'>
  # Create a Box app

  To use your own **Box App** you will need to create a new Box App in the **Box Developer Console**. 
  The following example uses OAuth2.0 but other authentication methods are available.

  1. Go to the [Developer Console][devconsole].
  2. Select **Create Platform App**.
  3. Enter an **App Name** and select *OAuth 2.0** as the **App Type**.
  4. In the **Configuration** tab, scroll down to the **OAuth 2.0 redirect URIs** configuration and set the **Redirect URI** to the value `https://developer.box.com/auth/callback`. It is important to note, if you visited this tutorial at `box.dev` your **Redirect URI** should be `https://box.dev/auth/callback`.
  5. Scroll down to the **Application Scopes** section to select your desired [permissions][scopes]. **Your application must have at least one or more** **of the following scopes:** manage users, read all files and folders stored in Box, read and write all files and folders in Box.
  6. At the top of the page click the button to **Save Changes**.
  7. From the **OAuth 2.0 Credentials section**, copy the values for the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**. We will use these credentials to authenticate your application in the next step.

</Choice>

  # Use existing Box app

  If you have already created a Box App, you can also use that. We require a few settings to be set for this to work. 
  The following example uses OAuth2.0 but other authentication methods are available.

  1. Go to the [Developer Console][devconsole].
  2. Select your application.
  3. Go to the app's **Configuration** tab.
  4. Make sure your application is using **Standard OAuth 2.0** as the authentication method.
  5. Scroll down to the **OAuth 2.0 redirect URI** configuration and set the **Redirect URI** to the value `https://developer.box.com/auth/callback`. It is important to note, if you visited this tutorial at `box.dev` your **Redirect URI** should be `https://box.dev/auth/callback`.
  6. Scroll down to the **Application Scopes** section to select your desired [permissions][scopes]. **Your application must have at least one or more** **of the following scopes:** manage users, read all files and folders stored in Box, read and write all files and folders in Box.
  7. At the top of the page click the button to **Save Changes**.
  8. From the **OAuth 2.0 Credentials section**, copy the values for the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**. We will use these credentials to authenticate your application in the next step.

</Choice>
{/*
  <Store id='postman_credentials.client_id' placeholder='zECq2EkYBjZ...' pattern='\w{32}'>
    Client ID
  </Store>

  <Store id='postman_credentials.client_secret' placeholder='913td9hr6jo...' pattern='\w{32}'>
    Client Secret
  </Store>

  We will use these credentials to authenticate your application in the next
  step.

  **Security notice**

  Your API credentials are now stored in the browser cache. We highly
  recommend clearing out this storage by clicking the **Reset** button later in
