  In this step, we will use the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from the
  previous step to log you in and create an **Access Token** for your user.

  ## The reason to log in
{/*
  Currently you have provided us with the following information.

  <Store disabled inline id='postman_credentials.client_id'>
    Client ID
  </Store>

  <Store disabled inline obscured id='postman_credentials.client_secret'>
    Client Secret
  </Store>
*/}

  The **Client ID** and **Client Secret** credentials allow any program or piece of code to authenticate
  itself to the **Box API**.  

  The next step in the process is to authenticate with [OAuth2.0 in Postman][Postman]:
  1. Open Postman and go to the **Authorization** tab
  2. Set the **Type** to **OAuth 2.0**
  3. Click **Get New Access Token**
  4. Complete the fields, including the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**
  5. Click **Request Token**

  Once the process is complete and approved, Postman will receive your access token[access_token] and refresh token[refresh_token].
{/*
  It represents the **Box App** you created but it
  doesn't tell the API who you, the **User**, is.
  
  To authenticate yourself you need to send your browser to the Box login
  screen to authorize your **Box App** to access your **User** account. 

  Setting this flow up can be hard, which is why we have made this
  straightforward for you with the button below.

  ## Log into your Box app

  <Trigger option='postman.login' value='clicked'>
    <LoginButton id='postman_credentials' />
  </Trigger>

  <LoggedIn id='postman_credentials'>
    ## You are now logged in

    We just sent your browser to the [Box Authorization](/reference/get-authorize)
    screen where you granted your application access to your user account. After
    you granted it access the browser redirected back to this site with a `code`.

    We then [exchanged](/reference/post-oauth2-token) this short-lived `code` for a
    longer lived **Access Token** and **Refresh Token**. These tokens represent
    you, the **User**.

    <Store disabled inline id='postman_credentials' field='name'>
      Your name
    </Store>

    <Store disabled inline obscured id='postman_credentials' field='access_token'>
      Access Token
    </Store>

    <Store disabled inline obscured id='postman_credentials' field='refresh_token'>
      Refresh Token
    </Store>

    <Danger>
      **Security notice**

      Your API credentials are now stored in the browser cache. We highly
      recommend clearing out this storage by clicking the **Reset** button
      later in this guide.

    Please complete the previous step to set up the **Box App** you want
    to use.
