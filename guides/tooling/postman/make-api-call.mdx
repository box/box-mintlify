With the **Box Postman Collection** loaded into the **Postman App** it is
possible to make API calls to the **Box API** on behalf of the user logged
in as.

<Warning>
  The Box Postman Collection will require a valid `access_token` environment
  variable to make API calls. To get your Postman App set up with a valid Access
  Token we recommend following our [Quick
  Start](/guides/tooling/postman/quick-start) guide.
</Warning>

## Make an API request

To make an API request, select a **Request** from the Box Postman Collection. In
this example, we will use the **List items in folder** API which can be found
in the **Folders** folder.

</Frame>

By default the `folder_id` for this API endpoint is set to `0` which represents
every user's root folder. You can leave this value as is or set it to the folder
ID of a folder you want to inspect.

Next, click the **Send** button in the top right to make the API request.

The API call should return quickly and show you a list of items
in your folder in the response **Body** tab in the bottom half of the screen.

<Warning>
  **Authentication error**

  At this point Postman might return an error instead of a list. Often,
  this means your **Access Token** has expired. Check our guide on [refreshing
  an access token in Postman](/guides/tooling/postman/refresh) for more details.
</Warning>
