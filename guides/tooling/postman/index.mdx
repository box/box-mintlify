[Postman][postman] is a tool that lets you build and test HTTP requests in an
easy-to-use interface without configuring a full development environment. The
**Box Postman Collection** is a set of preconfigured requests that make it
possible to get started with the Box API without having to manually configure
the requests.

The simplest way to get started with Postman is with our Postman Quick Start guide.
