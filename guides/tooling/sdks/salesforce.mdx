The Salesforce SDK can be deployed directly to Sandbox or Developer
organizations by using the [Deploy to Salesforce][deploy_salesforce]
functionality.

<Note>
  "Deploy to Salesforce" functionality is not owned or maintained by Box.
</Note>

The SDK is also distributed as an unmanaged package:

- [Production/Developer Package][salesforce_pkg_prod]
- [Sandbox Package][salesforce_pkg_sandbox]

<Warning>
  Unmanaged packages can't be upgraded once installed in a Salesforce org so
  future upgrades will have to be applied by cloning the repositories locally
  and updating classes from your IDE.
</Warning>
