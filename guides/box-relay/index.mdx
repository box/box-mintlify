[Box Relay][boxrelay] is a workflow automation application that enables Box
power users to automate and accelerate business processes centered
around content. Currently, there are two API <Link href="/reference/resources/workflow">endpoints</Link> developers
can use with more planned to be released in the future. Both were created to
work directly with [manual start flows][manualstart].

<Note>
  For more information on how to use these endpoints, refer to our [blog][blog]
  post.
</Note>

## Required Scopes

The following <Link href="/guides/api-calls/permissions-and-errors/scopes">scopes</Link> must be enabled for an application before use of
Box Relay's endpoints.

- <Link href="/guides/api-calls/permissions-and-errors/scopes/#read-all-files-and-folders">Read all files and folders stored in Box</Link>
- <Link href="/guides/api-calls/permissions-and-errors/scopes/#read-and-write-all-files-and-folders">Write all files and folders stored in Box</Link>
- <Link href="/guides/api-calls/permissions-and-errors/scopes/#manage-box-relay">Manage Box Relay</Link>

<Warning>
  Depending on the selected authentication method and enterprise's settings,
  your application may require Admin authorization or re-authorization before
  successful use of any newly selected scopes.
</Warning>

## Rate Limits

Please see our <Link href="/guides/api-calls/permissions-and-errors/rate-limits/#per-api-rate-limits">rate limit guide</Link> for more information.

## Testing

Due to the feature parity, it may be useful to familiarize yourself with
[Box Relay functionality using the Box web app][webapp] before leveraging the
API. As with all API endpoints, we recommend testing via
[developer sandbox environment][sandbox] to eliminate the risk of impacting
production content.
