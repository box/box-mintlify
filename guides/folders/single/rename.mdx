import {RelatedLinks, MultiRelatedLinks} from "/snippets/related-links.jsx";

To rename a folder in Box you will need to provide our API with a new `name` for
the folder.

{/* <Samples id='put_folders_id' variant='rename' /> */}

<Note>
  **Name restrictions**
  
  There are some restrictions to the folder name. Names containing non-printable
  ASCII characters, forward and backward slashes (`/`, `\`), as well as names
  with trailing spaces are prohibited.

  Additionally, the names `.` and `..` are reserved names and therefore
  also prohibited.
