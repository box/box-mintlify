To create a lock on a folder in Box you will need to provide our API with the
`id` of the folder for which the lock should be applied. Optionally you may
supply the specific `locked_operations` to be applied with the folder lock.

<Note>
  **Folder Locks**

  When using any folder lock API endpoints, you must be authenticated as the
  owner/co-owner of the folder you are trying to access.

```sh cURL
curl -i -X POST "https://api.box.com/2.0/folder_locks" \
     -H "authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>" \
     -H "content-type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "folder": {
         "type": "folder",
         "id": "33552487093"
       },
       "locked_operations": {
         "move": true,
         "delete": true
       }
     }'
```

```typescript Node/TypeScript v10
await client.folderLocks.createFolderLock({
  folder: {
    id: folder.id,
    type: 'folder',
  } satisfies CreateFolderLockRequestBodyFolderField,
  lockedOperations: {
    move: true,
    delete: true,
  } satisfies CreateFolderLockRequestBodyLockedOperationsField,
} satisfies CreateFolderLockRequestBody);
```

```python Python v10
client.folder_locks.create_folder_lock(
    CreateFolderLockFolder(id=folder.id, type="folder"),
    locked_operations=CreateFolderLockLockedOperations(move=True, delete=True),
)
```

```cs .NET v10
await client.FolderLocks.CreateFolderLockAsync(requestBody: new CreateFolderLockRequestBody(folder: new CreateFolderLockRequestBodyFolderField(id: folder.Id, type: "folder")) { LockedOperations = new CreateFolderLockRequestBodyLockedOperationsField(move: true, delete: true) });
```

```swift Swift v10
try await client.folderLocks.createFolderLock(requestBody: CreateFolderLockRequestBody(folder: CreateFolderLockRequestBodyFolderField(id: folder.id, type: "folder"), lockedOperations: CreateFolderLockRequestBodyLockedOperationsField(move: true, delete: true)))
```

```java Java v10
client.getFolderLocks().createFolderLock(new CreateFolderLockRequestBody.Builder(new CreateFolderLockRequestBodyFolderField("folder", folder.getId())).lockedOperations(new CreateFolderLockRequestBodyLockedOperationsField(true, true)).build())
```

<Warning>
  **Setting Locked Operations**

  If the `locked_operations` object is included with a folder lock request,
  both `move` and `delete` need to be set to `true`. Supplying only one lock
  operation in the object, or setting the values of both to something other
  than `true` will produce an error. These options are in place to allow
  for additional operations in the future.
</Warning>

## Lock Operations

There are two possible lock operations that may be applied to a folder, `move`
and `delete`.

The `move` lock will prevent the folder from being moved to a new location or
owner while the lock is still applied.

The `delete` lock will prevent the folder from being deleted while the lock is
still applied.
