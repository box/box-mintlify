To remove a lock applied to a folder in Box, call the
`DELETE /folder_locks/:id` API with the id of the folder lock.

<Note>
  **Folder Locks**

  When using any folder lock API endpoints, you must be authenticated as the
  owner/co-owner of the folder you are trying to access.

```sh cURL
curl -i -X DELETE "https://api.box.com/2.0/folder_locks/93134" \
     -H "authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>"
```

client.folder_locks.delete_folder_lock_by_id(folder_lock.id)

<Note>
  **Locating the folder Lock ID**

  To delete a folder lock you must supply the folder lock ID to the API. A
  folder lock ID is supplied in the response when
  <Link href="/guides/folders/single/create-lock">creating a folder lock</Link>, or
  when <Link href="/guides/folders/single/get-locks">listing locks</Link> on a given folder.
