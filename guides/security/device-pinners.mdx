Building on the login tracking feature – which allows admins to set limits on
the number of devices a user can access Box from and sends alerts to them and
the user whenever a new device is used to access that Box account – Box has
additional device management functionality to increase security when accessing
Box on mobile or desktop devices: device pinning.

To learn more about device pinning, please see our [community
documentation][community].
