You've reached the end of this Quick Start guide. By now you should have taken
the following steps.

1. <Link href="/guides/mobile/ios/quick-start/create-ios-app">Created a new iOS app</Link> in Xcode.
2. <Link href="/guides/mobile/ios/quick-start/install-ios-sdk">Installed the iOS SDK</Link> into your project.
3. <Link href="/guides/mobile/ios/quick-start/configure-box-app">Configured a Box App</Link> so that the iOS SDK can access the Box API.
4. <Link href="/guides/mobile/ios/quick-start/make-api-call">Made your first API call</Link> to the Box API with the iOS SDK.

## Next things to do

To take the next step with your application, the following resources are
recommended.

* <Link href="/guides/authentication/tokens/downscope">Token Downscoping</Link>: In this quick start guide you used a developer token to make your first call. To implement a scalable solution you should have a server-side solution to generate downscoped tokens to replace that implementation.
* [Official JWT sample application][sample-jwt]: Bundled with the iOS SDK, this sample application will get you started quickly with a properly structured Box JWT application, which doesn't require user login.
* [Official OAuth 2 sample application][sample-oauth]: Bundled with the iOS SDK, this sample application will get you started quickly with a properly structured Box OAuth 2 application, which requires user login.
