To delete a Box Hub, call the <Link href="/reference/delete-hubs-id">delete hub</Link> endpoint with the hub ID. The hub and its association with content are removed; the underlying files and folders in Box are not deleted.

## Delete hub

<CodeGroup>

```sh cURL
curl -i -X DELETE "https://api.box.com/2.0/hubs/HUB_ID" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>" \
     -H "box-version: 2025.0"
```

```typescript Node/TypeScript v10
await client.hubs.deleteHubByIdV2025R0(hubId);
```

```python Python v10
client.hubs.delete_hub_by_id_v2025_r0(hub_id)
```

```csharp .NET v10
await client.Hubs.DeleteHubByIdV2025R0Async(hubId: hubId);
```

```swift Swift v10

```

```java Java v10
client.getHubs().deleteHubByIdV2025R0(hubId);
```

Replace `HUB_ID` with the actual hub ID. A successful response has no response body (HTTP 204). The caller must have permission to delete the hub.
