Managing content portals at scale can be challenging due to the need for manual curation, complex permission management, and inconsistent user experiences across teams.

The Box Hubs API provides the programmatic control for automating the creation, management, and governance of content portals. It handles the complexity—orchestration, security inheritance, and content indexing—so you can build scalable knowledge bases and embed them directly into your applications.

The Box Hubs API empowers developers to:

- **Scale faster:** Automate Hub creation and management using APIs to replace tedious manual configuration with event-driven workflows.
- **Minimize maintenance:** Programmatically inherit Box's enterprise-grade governance, ensuring sensitive data stays protected without building custom security frameworks.
- **Reduce complexity:** Seamlessly embed AI-powered content portals into existing internal portals or third-party tools instead of building custom interfaces from scratch.

## Core Benefits of using the Box Hubs API

- **Security & Compliance:** All content within a Hub inherits the permissions of the underlying source files. The Hubs API respects Box's enterprise-grade security framework, eliminating the need for developers to build custom authentication or encryption layers.
- **AI-Ready Infrastructure:** Hubs are pre-indexed for Box AI. By using the Hubs API, you are tapping into your company's knowledge base, without the complexity of building and maintaining custom RAG systems or storing content in a vector database.
- **Model-Neutral Flexibility:** Box AI in Hubs allows you to leverage the latest, most powerful LLMs to query your curated content without being locked into a single AI provider.
