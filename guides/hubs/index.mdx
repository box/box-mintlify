Box Hubs provide a centralized way to organize content for specific teams, departments, or projects within your organization. They serve as content portals that bring together files, folders, and web links in a structured, easily accessible manner. Box Hubs are integrated with Box AI, allowing for more accurate responses thanks to a narrowed context window.

The Box Hubs API lets you programmatically manage Box Hubs, their content, and collaborations. There are three groups of endpoints:

- **Box Hubs:** Create, get, list, update, delete, and copy hubs.
- **Box Hub items:** List items in a hub and add or remove files, folders, and web links.
- **Box Hub collaborations:** Create, list, get, update, and delete hub collaborations to control who can access a hub and at what role.

<Note>

**Required version header**

Box Hubs endpoints require the `box-version` header. Not passing this parameter will result in a `400` error: "Missing required box-version header. Supported API versions: [2025.0]."

Include `box-version: 2025.0` in every Hubs API request. For more on versioning, see the <Link href="/guides/api-calls/api-versioning-strategy">API versioning strategy</Link> guide.
