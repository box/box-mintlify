Before you can start working with [Teams][2] integration mapping API,
perform the steps below.

## Prerequisites

* Admin or Co-Admin role
* [Box for Microsoft Teams][1] integration installed

## Create a Box application

1. Create a <Link href="/guides/authentication/oauth2/oauth2-setup">platform app with OAuth authentication</Link> in the [Box developer console][4].
2. Open the application and enable the **Manage enterprise properties** application scope under **Configuration** > **Required Access Scopes**.

## Authorize integration mappings requests

1. Navigate to the <Link href="/guides/applications/app-types/platform-apps">platform app</Link> that you have created as one of the prerequisites.
2. Generate a <Link href="/guides/authentication/tokens/developer-tokens">developer token</Link> and add it to the HTTP header of each request:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer {developer_token}
```

<Info>
  The developer token is valid for 60 minutes. After that time, you need
  to generate it again.
