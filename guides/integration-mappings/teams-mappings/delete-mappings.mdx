title: "Delete Teams integration mappings"

The `DELETE integration_mappings_teams_id` call removes the mapping between
the channel and the folder. 
A new mapping and a new folder in the default folder structure will be created
when the next file is uploaded to the channel.
Deleting the mapping does not delete the Box folder or the Teams channel.
