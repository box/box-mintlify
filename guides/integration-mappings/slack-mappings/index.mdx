When [Box as the Content Layer][1] is enabled, Box folder is created for
each channel, and all files uploaded to this channel are stored in this folder.
The <Link href="/reference/resources/integration-mapping">Integration Mappings API</Link> allows the Box Enterprise Admin (EA) to
customize the upload folder of the Slack channel to any folder within
the enterprise instead of relying on the default one.
