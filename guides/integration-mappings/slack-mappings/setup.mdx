Before starting work with Integration Mappings API, perform
the following steps.

## Roles

Make sure you have an Admin or a Co-admin role.

## Install and configure Box for Slack

1. Install [Box for Slack][1] in the relevant Slack workspace or organizations.
2. Enable the [Box as Content Layer for Slack][2].
3. Make sure the service account you are using is a collaborator on the folder that will be mapped. To do so, use the `Invite People` folder option to invite the service account as a collaborator.

If you encounter any errors, see the <Link href="/guides/integration-mappings/slack-mappings/troubleshooting">troubleshooting guide</Link>.

## Create Box application

1. Create a <Link href="/guides/authentication/oauth2/oauth2-setup">platform app with OAuth authentication</Link> in the [Box developer console][5]
2. Open the application and enable the **Manage enterprise properties** application scope under **Configuration** > **Required Access Scopes**.

<Info>
  For Slack-side channel validation, the <Link href="/reference/get-integration-mappings-slack">Integration Mappings API</Link>
  is calling the Slack API.
</Info>

## Authorization

To authorize your Integration Mappings requests:

1. Navigate to the <Link href="/guides/applications/app-types/platform-apps">platform app</Link> that you have created as one of the prerequisites.
2. Generate a <Link href="/guides/authentication/tokens/developer-tokens">developer token</Link> and add it to the HTTP header of each request:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer {developer_token}
```

<Info>
  The developer token is valid for 60 minutes. After that time you need
  to generate it again.
