Box Doc Gen allows you to generate business documents such as offer letters, sales contracts, invoices or agreements.
You can generate documents based on Box Doc Gen templates uploaded to Box, with data fields that can be dynamically filled using Box Doc Gen API.

<Note>
Box Doc Gen only supports the ability to leverage English template tags when
using Box Doc Gen templates. We recommend that customers test and review that Box Doc Gen supports their desired language requirements.

## Prerequisites

To use Box Doc Gen, you must have access to Microsoft Word, as it is required

Gen Add-in for a code-free experience or apply tagging scripts within Word to

<Note>
Box Doc Gen is designed to facilitate the dynamic generation of business
documents, but it is important to note that Box does not have control over
users’ access to Microsoft Word. Users must ensure they have the necessary
permissions and access to Microsoft Word to create and author document
templates effectively.
