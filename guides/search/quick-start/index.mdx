The Box Metadata Query API enables programmatic search of Box content based
strictly on applied custom metadata values.

The structure of a metadata query is similar to that of a SQL query and allows
for Boolean operators, such as AND, OR, and NOT, as well as comparison or range
operators, such as equal to, greater-than, and less-than.

Some benefits of the Metadata Query API include:

* no indexing delay; query immediately after metadata creations, updates, and deletions
* ability to specify a sort order by one or more fields
* no limitation on the number of characters that are queryable
* queries return item properties and metadata instances
