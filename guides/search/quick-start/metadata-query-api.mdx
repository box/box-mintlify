import { ProgressBar } from '/snippets/progress-bar.jsx';

<ProgressBar pages={[
                          "guides/search/quick-start/create-metadata-template",
                          "guides/search/quick-start/locate-template-info",
                          "guides/search/quick-start/apply-template-to-file",
                          "guides/search/quick-start/metadata-query-api",
                          "guides/search/quick-start/next-steps"
                        ]} />

Finally, build a [metadata query API call][mq]. Here is an example of what the
body of the API call looks like:

```json
{
  "from": "enterprise_22201764.contact_role",
  "query": "departments = :departments",
  "query_params": {"departments": "legal"},
  "ancestor_folder_id": "0",
  "fields": ["id"]
}
```

This API call will return any file ID that meets the following criteria: 

- Has the Contact Role template applied
- Has a value of departments is legal
- Is located anywhere under the root folder, since "0" is the `ancestor_folder_id`

As you can see below, this results in a successful call showing information
about the file we added the template to in step 2.
