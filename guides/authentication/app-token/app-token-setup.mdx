A Limited Access App can be set up to use server-side <Link href="/guides/authentication/app-token">App Tokens</Link>
for authentication.

<Card href="/guides/authentication/app-token" arrow title="Learn how App Token authentication works"/>

## Prerequisites

To set up a Platform App using server-side authentication, you will need to ensure
you have access the [Developer Console][devconsole] from your Box enterprise
account. Alternatively, you may sign up for a [developer account][devaccount].

## App creation steps

### 1. Log in to the Developer Console

Log into Box and navigate to the [Developer Console][devconsole].
Select **Create Platform App**.

### 2. Create a Platform App

Select **Limited Access App** from the list of application types.
A modal will appear to prompt the next step.

## App Authorization

Once a keypair is successfully added to your application your Box enterprise
Admin needs to authorize the application within the Box Admin Console.

Navigate to the **General Settings** tab for your application within the
[Developer Console][devconsole] and scroll down to the **App Authorization**
section.

</Frame>

Click **Submit and Review** to send an email to your Box enterprise Admin for
approval. More information on this process is available in our
<Link href="/guides/authorization">authorization guide</Link>.

## Basic configuration

Before the application can be used, some basic additional configuration might be
required.

### Primary and Secondary App Tokens

Authentication with Limited Access Apps is done through preconfigured <Link href="/guides/authentication/app-token">App
Tokens</Link>. To configure an app token, navigate to the **Configuration**
tab for your application within the [Developer Console][devconsole].

Scroll down to the **Primary Access Token** section and click the
**Generate Key** button.

<Frame border width="600" center>

</Frame>

App tokens can be configured to automatically expire or be valid indefinitely.
After creation, the key can be used to make <Link href="/guides/api-calls">API calls</Link>.

<Warning>
  **App authorization**

  App Tokens can not be generated until the application is successfully
  authorized within the Box Admin Console.
</Warning>

### CORS Domains

If your application makes API calls from front-end browser code in
Javascript, the domain that these calls are made from will need to be
added to an allow-list due to [Cross Origin Resource Sharing][cors],
also known as CORS. If all requests will be made from server-side code,
you may skip this section.

To add the full URI(s) to the allow-list, navigate to the **CORS Domain**
section at the bottom of the **Configuration** tab in the
[Developer Console][devconsole].
