Every authenticated API call requires an Access Token to be passed in the
`Authorization` header as a `Bearer Token` or it will return a `401 Unauthorized`
HTTP status.

```sh
curl https://api.box.com/2.0/users/me \
    -H "authorization: Bearer EGmDmRVfhfHsqesn5yVYHAqUkD0dyDfk"
```

<Info>
  Use the [`GET /users/me`](/reference/get-users-id) endpoint to inspect what
  user an Access Token is authenticated for.
