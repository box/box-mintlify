A Developer Token is an Access Token available to developers during development
and testing. These tokens are short lived, as they expire after 60 minutes, and
cannot be refreshed programmatically.

## Create Developer Token

To create a Developer Token for an application:

- Navigate to the Box [Developer Console][devconsole] and select the application to create a Developer Token for.
- Select the **Configuration** tab.
- Under Developer Token, select **Generate Developer Token**.

<Info>
You can also generate a Developer Token directly from <Link href="/guides/applications">My Platform Apps</Link>
view, using the menu available for each app.

## Using Developer Token

A Developer Token can be used like any Access Token in the `Authorization`
header of an API call.

```sh
curl https://api.box.com/2.0/users/me \
    -H "authorization: Bearer [DEVELOPER_TOKEN]"
```

<Warning>
  A Developer Token is associated with the the user that is logged in to the
  Developer Console when the token is generated.
</Warning>

Our SDKs can be initialized with a Developer Token to create a basic API client.

```sh
curl https://api.box.com/2.0/users/me \
    -H "authorization: Bearer [DEVELOPER_TOKEN]"
```

<Danger>
  **Developer tokens should not be used in production environments**

Developer Tokens should only be used for development or testing purposes.
</Danger>

<Warning>
  When you explicitly revoke a developer token for a given app via the
  Developer console, all webhooks created by that application get deleted.
</Warning>
