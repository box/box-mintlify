At the core of every Box API call is an Access Token.
Similar to using the Box Web App, you will only be able to successfully interact
with content the user associated with the Access Token either a collaborator on
or owns. This can be further restricted by <Link href="/guides/authentication/tokens/downscope">downscoping</Link> a token.

<Warning>
  Required access scopes, application access, enabled advanced settings, user
  permissions, and endpoint-specific restrictions all work together to determine
  which API calls will be successful. For example, even if a user has
  collaborator access to a folder, a call to get information about the folder
  will not be successful if the read scope is not granted to the application.
</Warning>
