The SDKs have direct support for JWT and OAuth 2.0 authentication, yet in some
cases your application might need to provide an Access Token to the SDK directly.

{/* <Samples id='x_auth' variant='init_with_access_and_refresh_token' /> */}

## Developer Token

Similarly, developer tokens can be used directly in SDKs without needing any
further SDK configuration.

{/* <Samples id='x_auth' variant='init_with_dev_token' /> */}

## App Token

When using App Token authentication it is possible to directly pass the App
Token to the SDKs.

{/* <Samples id='x_auth' variant='init_with_app_token' /> */}
