The official Box SDKs have built-in support for JWT authentication.

This guide will take you through user authentication using JWT with the use
of the Box SDKs. JWT authentication is designed for working directly with the
Box API without requiring a user to redirect through Box to authorize your
application.

## Overview

To complete a JWT authorization the following steps need to be completed.

1. Read the configuration file
2. Initialize an SDK client

At the end of this flow, the application has a Box SDK client that can be used to
make API calls on behalf of the application.

<Note>
  The default method of authentication through JWT is inherently tied to the Service
  Account for the application. Any API call made with this token will seem to
  come from this application and will not have access to files and folders from
  other users without explicitly getting access them.
</Note>

## Prerequisites

Before we can get started, you will need to have completed the following steps.

- Create a Box Application within the developer console
- Create and download the private key configuration file for your application and save it as `config.json`
- Ensure your Box Application is approved for usage within your enterprise

## 1. Read JSON configuration

After creating a Box Application there should be a `config.json` file containing
the application's private key and other details. The following is an example.

```json config.json
{
  "boxAppSettings": {
    "clientID": "abc...123",
    "clientSecret": "def...234",
    "appAuth": {
      "publicKeyID": "abcd1234",
      "privateKey": "-----BEGIN ENCRYPTED PRIVATE KEY-----\n....\n-----END ENCRYPTED PRIVATE KEY-----\n",
      "passphrase": "ghi...345"
    }
  },
  "enterpriseID": "1234567"
}
```

To use this object in the application it needs to be read from file.

<CodeGroup>
```csharp .Net
var reader = new StreamReader("path/to/config.json");
var json = reader.ReadToEnd();
var config = BoxConfig.CreateFromJsonString(json);
```

```java Java
Reader reader = new FileReader("path/to/config.json");
BoxConfig config = BoxConfig.readFrom(reader);
```

```python Python
from boxsdk import JWTAuth

config = JWTAuth.from_settings_file('path/to/config.json')
```

```js Node
var config = require("path/to/config.json");
```
</CodeGroup>

<Info>
  **Parsing JSON**

In some programming languages there is more than one way to read and parse
JSON from a file. Refer to guides on your preferred programming language for
more complete guides, including error handling.

</Info>

## 2. Initialize SDK client

The next step is to configure the Box SDK with the configuration and then
initialize the client to connect as the application.

<CodeGroup>
```csharp .Net
var sdk = new BoxJWTAuth(config);
var token = sdk.AdminToken();
BoxClient client = sdk.AdminClient(token);
```

```java Java
BoxDeveloperEditionAPIConnection api = BoxDeveloperEditionAPIConnection.getAppEnterpriseConnection(config);
```

```python Python
client = Client(config)
```

```js Node
var sdk = BoxSDK.getPreconfiguredInstance(config);
var client = sdk.getAppAuthClient("enterprise");
```
</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
**Service Accounts**

At this point the application is authenticated as an application user, not as
a managed or app user. Head over to our guide on <Link href="/platform/user-types">User
Types</Link> to learn more about the different types
of users.

**Summary**

By now the application should be able to authorize an application using JWT
with any of our official SDKs, by using the following steps.

1. Read the configuration file
2. Initialize an SDK client

To learn how to use this client head over to the guide on <Link href="/guides/api-calls">Making API
calls</Link>.
