A Platform App can be set up to use server-side authentication with
<Link href="/guides/authentication/jwt">JWT</Link>.

<Card href="/guides/authentication/jwt" arrow title="Learn how JWT authentication works"/>

## Prerequisites

To set up a Platform App using server-side authentication, you will need to ensure
you have access the [Developer Console][devconsole] from your Box enterprise
account. Alternatively, you may sign up for a [developer account][devaccount].

## App creation steps

### Navigate to the Developer Console

Log into Box and go to the [Developer Console][devconsole].
Select **Create Platform App**.

### Select application type

Select **Platform App** from the list of application types. A modal will appear to
prompt a selection for the next step.

<Frame border>
  ![Application selection screen](/images/guides/authentication/select-app-type.png)
</Frame>

### Provide basic application information

To describe your app, provide an app name and description.
Use the drop-down list to select the app's purpose. Depending on the option chosen, you might need to specify further details.

| Purpose | Details|
|------| --------|
|Automation, Custom Portal| Specify if the app is built by a customer or partner. |
|Integration|  Specify the integration category, external system name if the app is built by a customer or partner. |
|Other| Specify the app purpose and if it is built by a customer or partner. |

### Select application authentication

Select **Server Authentication (with JWT)** if you would like to verify
application identity <Link href="/guides/authentication/jwt/without-sdk/#public-and-private-key-pair">with a key pair</Link> and confirm with **Create Platform App**.

<Warning>
Once you make a selection, you will not be able to change to a different
authentication method without creating a new application.
</Warning>

<Frame border width="300" center>

</Frame>

## Public and private key pair

<Info>
  This section can be skipped if you selected Server Authentication
  (Client Credentials Grant) as your authentication method.
</Info>

Once a Platform App is created leveraging Server Authentication with JWT, a key
pair can be generated via the configuration tab within the
[Developer Console][devconsole]. Alternatively, you can generate your
own and supply Box with the public key. Regardless of the method you select,
your Box account will need to have [2FA][2fa] enabled for security purposes.

### Generate a keypair (Recommended)

If you would like to use a Box generated keypair, navigate to the
[Developer Console][devconsole] where you can generate a configuration file.
This file includes a public/private keypair and a number of other application
details that are necessary for authentication.

To generate this file, navigate to the **Configuration** tab of the
[Developer Console][devconsole] and scroll down to the
**Add and Manage Public Keys** section.

<Frame border width="600" center>
  ![Add and Manage keys](/images/guides/authentication/app-add-keys.png)
</Frame>

Click the **Generate a Public/Private Keypair** button to have Box generate a
keypair you. This will trigger the download of a JSON configuration file that
you can move to your application code.

<Danger>
  For security reasons, Box will not store your private key. If you lose your
  private key, you will need to reset the entire keypair.
</Danger>

### Manually add keypair

Alternatively, you may generate your own keypair and upload the public key to
the [Developer Console][devconsole].

To create a keypair using OpenSSL, open a terminal window and run the
following commands.

```shell
openssl genrsa -des3 -out private.pem 2048
openssl rsa -in private.pem -outform PEM -pubout -out public.pem
```

<Info>
  **For Windows Systems**

  Windows users can install and use the [Cygwin][cygwin] package to run OpenSSL.
</Info>

Then, navigate to the configuration tab for your application within the
[Developer console][devconsole] and scroll down to the
**Add and Manage Public Keys** section.

<Frame border width="600" center>
  ![Add and Manage keys](/images/guides/authentication/app-add-keys.png)
</Frame>

Click the **Add a Public Key** button, enter the public key generated using the
steps above and click **Verify and Save**.

## App Authorization

Before the application can be used, a Box Admin needs to authorize the
application within the Box Admin Console.

Navigate to the **Authorization** tab for your application within the
[Developer Console][devconsole].

<Frame border center>
  ![App authorization](/images/guides/authentication/app-authorization.png)
</Frame>

Click **Review and Submit** to send an email to your Box enterprise Admin for
approval. More information on this process is available in our
[support article for app authorization][app-auth].

<Card href="/guides/authorization/platform-app-approval" arrow title="Learn how to authorize a Platform Application"/>

## Basic configuration

### Application Access

An application's access level determines which users and content your app may
access. By default, an application can only successfully interact with the
content of its <Link href="/platform/user-types/#service-account">Service Account</Link> and any <Link href="/platform/user-types">App Users</Link>.
To access existing Managed Users of an
enterprise and groups that were not created by
the app itself, navigate to the **Application Access**
settings accessible in the **Configuration** tab of the
[Developer console][devconsole] and set
to **App + Enterprise Access**. Otherwise access to such
Managed Users and groups will be blocked.

### Application Scopes

An application's scopes determine which endpoints and resources an application
can successfully call. See the <Link href="/guides/api-calls/permissions-and-errors/scopes">scopes guide</Link> for detailed information
on each option.

<Frame>
![App scopes](/images/guides/authentication/app-scopes.png)
</Frame>

### CORS Domains

If your application makes API calls from front-end browser code in
Javascript, the domain that these calls are made from will need to be
added to an allow-list due to [Cross Origin Resource Sharing][cors],
also known as CORS. If all requests will be made from server-side code,
you may skip this section.

To add the full URI(s) to the allow-list, navigate to the **CORS Domain**
section at the bottom of the **Configuration** tab in the
[Developer console][devconsole].
