It is possible to for a JWT application to act on behalf of another user
by leveraging the `as-user` header.

```sh
curl https://api.box.com/2.0/folders/0 \
    -H "as-user: [USER_ID]"
    -H "authorization: Bearer [ACCESS_TOKEN]"
```

<Info>
In this situation the user ID is the Box identifier for a user. User IDs can
found for any user via the `GET /users` endpoint, which is only available to
admins, or by calling the `GET /users/me` endpoint with an authenticated user
session.
</Info>

## Preconditions

The application must be configured to perform actions as users in the
[Developer Console][devconsole].

Additionally, the authenticated user needs to be a user with Admin permissions,
meaning either an Admin or Co-Admin. See our guide on
<Link href="/platform/user-types">User Types</Link> for more details.

<Info>
You cannot use the `user_id` of
<Link href="/platform/user-types/#service-account">Service Accounts</Link>
in the as-user header.
</Info>

## as-user using SDKs

All of the [official Box SDKs][sdk] support acting on behalf of a user using the
`as-user` header.

<CodeGroup>
```csharp .NET
var user_client = new BoxClient(config, session, asUser: '[USER_ID]');
```
```java Java
client.asUser([USER_ID]");
// client.asSelf();
```
```python Python
user_to_impersonate = client.user(user_id='[USER_ID]')
user_client = client.as_user(user_to_impersonate)
```
```js Node
client.asUser('[USER_ID]');
// client.asSelf();
```

</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
  Please note that some of our SDKs create new clients for the other user, while
  others modify the existing client and provide a way to return to a state where
  the client authenticates for the original user itself.
