It is possible to for an OAuth 2.0 application to act on behalf of another user
through the `as-user` header.

```sh
curl https://api.box.com/2.0/folders/0 \
    -H "as-user: [USER_ID]"
    -H "authorization: Bearer [ACCESS_TOKEN]"
```

<Info>
In this situation the user ID is the Box identifier for a user. User IDs can be
found for any user via the `GET /users` endpoint, which is only available to
admins, or by calling the `GET /users/me` endpoint with an authenticated user session.
</Info>

## Preconditions

Using the `as-user` header has a few requirements. Firstly, the application
needs to be configured to perform actions as users in the [Developer
Console][devconsole].

</Frame>

Additionally, the authenticated user needs to be a user with admin permissions,
meaning either an admin, co-admin, or service account. Co-admin users will also
need the 'Manage Users' permission scope. See our guide on [User
Types](/platform/user-types) for more details.

## as-user using SDKs

<CodeGroup>
```csharp .NET
var user_client = new BoxClient(config, session, asUser: '[USER_ID]');
```

```java Java
client.asUser([USER_ID]");
// client.asSelf();
```

```python Python
user_to_impersonate = client.user(user_id='[USER_ID]')
user_client = client.as_user(user_to_impersonate)
```

```js Node
client.asUser('[USER_ID]');
// client.asSelf();
```
</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
  Please note that some of our SDKs create new clients for the other user, while
  others modify the existing client and provide a way to return to a state where
  the client authenticates for the original user itself.
