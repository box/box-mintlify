Paginating the event stream works through the use of the `stream_position`
parameter.

First, send a request to the <Link href="/reference/get-events">`GET /events`</Link> API without a
`stream_position` query parameter.

```sh
curl https://api.box.com/2.0/events \
    -H "authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

The API will return all available events beginning with the oldest. The response
will also include a `next_stream_position` value that can be used to make the
next API call for the next place in the stream.

```sh
curl https://api.box.com/2.0/events?stream_position=388720462721 \
    -H "authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

The `stream_position` can also be set to `now` to return the most recent stream
position.

```sh
curl https://api.box.com/2.0/events?stream_position=now \
    -H "authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

In this case, the API returns an empty list and a `next_stream_position` that
can be used for the next call.
