A full list of CLI commands and usage information can be found in the
[GitHub repository][github].

<Warning>
  Only Service Accounts and Admins are able to use some commands.
  If your user is not authorized with the necessary scopes or you
  configured your CLI to obtain a default token for another user, calls may
  fail. Add `-v` or `--verbose` to your command for verbose error logging.
</Warning>

If you do not see a command for an endpoint you need, you can build a
[custom request][custom].

<Tip>
  Use repository documentation in conjunction with reference documentation to
  see information the help command does not provide. This includes
  restrictions, token permission requirements, fields, etc.

## First: Reset browser storage

Now that you've imported the Box API credentials into the CLI you should take a
moment to remove these credentials from your browser's storage.

<ResetButton id='cli,credentials,observable_events'>
  Clear credentials
</ResetButton>

<Warning>
  Removing your API credentials from the browser storage ensures that no other
  script can read your **Client ID** or **Client Secret**
</Warning>

## Creating a folder with help

{/* alex ignore executing */}

Every CLI command begins with `box`. Add the option `--help` to any
command for help building it. For example, executing `box --help` will bring you
to a list of all possible object commands. Options are discussed more in
[step 4][four].

<Frame center>
  ![Help](/images/guides/cli/help.png)
</Frame>

{/* alex ignore execute */}

Then, for example, use the folder object and execute the command
`box folders --help`. This provides a list of all eligible actions for this
object.

  ![Help](/images/guides/cli/folders-help.png)
</Frame>

Discover the required arguments for creating a folder: `box folders:create --help`

<Frame center>
  ![Help](/images/guides/cli/folders-create-help.png)
</Frame>

{/* alex ignore execute */}

Execute the command `box folders:create 0 "My CLI Folder"` and note the folder
ID returned in the response.

<Tip>
  The root level of the folder tree, the All Files page, is always represented
  by folder ID 0.
</Tip>

Log into **your** Box account. Can you see this folder in your folder tree?

<Warning>
  If you set up the Box CLI using JWT authentication, you will not see the
  folder in your Box account. The folder will live in the service account
  of the application that was created after application approval.
</Warning>

## Summary

- You used the **help** feature to create a folder
