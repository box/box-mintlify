## Options

Options provide additional, optional functionality to use with a CLI command.
You may also hear these referred to as flags or arguments. As mentioned in the
previous step, `--help` is an example of an option.

To see all valid options for a command, visit the [GitHub repository][github].

For example, look at the command documentation for [deleting folders][df]. You
will see a list of options to use with this command, such as `--recursive` or
`--force`.

## As-User Header

To use the <Link href="/guides/authentication/jwt/as-user">as-user header</Link>, add the `--as-user=USERID` option to the
end of the command.

For example, the following command will create a folder called `Example_Folder`
at the root level in user ID 123456’s account.

```bash
box folders:create 0 Example_Folder --as-user=123456
```

<Warning>
  Only Service Accounts and Admins are able to use the as-user header.
  If your application was not authorized with the necessary scopes or you
  configured your CLI to obtain a default token for another user, this call may
  fail. Add `-v` or `--verbose` to your command for verbose error logging.
</Warning>

## Bulk Commands
{/* alex ignore execute */}
You can use a CSV file to execute commands in bulk. Each row of the
spreadsheet is treated as an individual API call.
{/* alex ignore execute */}
To execute a bulk command, use the option `--bulk-file-path=<PATH_TO_CSV>`, where
`<PATH_TO_CSV>` is the local path of a CSV file containing the
necessary information.

As an example, let's create folders using the command `box folders:create --bulk-file-path=pathtoacsv`

<Tip>
  Drag the CSV file from your finder window/file explorer to the
  terminal/command line window to auto-populate the path.
</Tip>

To specify the column names for your CSV file, go to the [GitHub repository][github]
documentation and look at the argument names or use the `--help` option. In this
case, these are `PARENTID` and `NAME` and are case insensitive.
You can also use a CSV
[template][csv] for this example bulk create folders command.

{/* alex ignore executing */}
Executing the command below creates three folders at the root level, 0, of the
Service Account's folder tree.

```bash
box folders:create --bulk-file-path=/Users/ExampleUser/Desktop/bulkcreatefolders.csv
```

## Bulk Commands with Options

Passing an option in a command will automatically apply to it to each row in
the CSV file. For example,
`box folders:collaborations:create --bulk-file-path=pathtocsv --role=editor`
will create collaborations for each user in the csv as an editor.

However, you can also use options in the CSV file. Building on the last example,
instead of using the `--role=editor` option in the command itself, it can be a
column called `role`. The command itself becomes:
`box folders:collaborations:create --bulk-file-path=pathtocsv`
