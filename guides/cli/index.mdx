The Box Command Line Interface (CLI) is a tool for making requests to
Box APIs from your terminal window or command prompt.

## Quick start

<Link href="/guides/cli/quick-start">Get started using the Box CLI with OAuth 2.0</Link>.

## CLI setup and use

- To use <Link href="/guides/authentication/jwt">server authentication</Link> method, check out <Link href="/guides/cli/cli-docs/jwt-cli">this</Link> guide.
- To use <Link href="/guides/authentication/client-credentials">CCG authentication</Link> method, check out [this][ccg-page] guide.
- To perform bulk actions using CLI commands, check out [this][bulk] guide.

## Sample scripts

Using the Box CLI is great by itself, but it becomes even more powerful when
combined with a Powershell script. We've created a [library][scripts]
of script templates for you to get started automating repetitive tasks.
