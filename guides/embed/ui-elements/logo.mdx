Each of the Box UI Elements allow for specifying a custom logo to place in the
top-left corner of the embedded container.

<Frame border>
  ![Custom logo](/images/guides/embed/ui-elements/elements-logo.png)
</Frame>

By default, each of the UI Elements uses a generic placeholder as a logo. This
is meant to be replaced by either a Box logo or a custom logo, such as a
company's logo.

To add a logo to a UI Element, supply a URL for a logo as an option in in the
Javascript setup code. The following is an example of how to do this with the
Content Preview UI Element.

```js
var preview = new Box.Preview();
preview.show(fileId, accessToken, {
    container: '.preview-container',
    sharedLink: 'https://app.box.com/v/foo',
    sharedLinkPassword: 'bar',
    collection: [FILE_ID, '123', '234', ...],
    header: 'light',
    logoUrl: 'http://i.imgur.com/xh8j3E2.png',
    showAnnotations: true,
    showDownload: true
});
```

<Info>
  **Box Logo**

  To present the Box logo in a UI Element, specify the string `box` as the
  `logoURL` option.
