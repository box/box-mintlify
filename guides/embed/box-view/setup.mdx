Before uploading files to Box and previewing them using Box View, a Box
application must be created and an access token be generated for that
application.

## Create App Token App

Box View uses an authentication mechanism called **App Token Auth** to store
files directly within the account of the application as opposed to a specific
Box user. This permits the previewing of files without having to associate the
content with a user.

The first step is to create the application and authorize it through your admin
to begin making API requests to Box.

<Warning>
  App Token apps need to be authorized by the Box admin, otherwise you will
  receive permission errors when making API requests. To go through app
  authorization, follow <Link href="/guides/authorization/platform-app-approval">this guide</Link>.
</Warning>

## Generate Access Token

With your application loaded, click on the **Configuration** option in the left
navigation menu. The configuration page for your application should look like
the following.

Click on the **Generate Key** button within the **Primary Access Token**
section.

<Note>
  If you don't have 2FA setup for your developer account, you will be prompted
  to set up 2FA before you can successfully generate App Tokens. Follow the
  prompt to set up 2FA.
</Note>

Choose the expiration time for your token, either 30 days, 60 days, or set the
token to never expire.

Once the app token is generated, copy and store it securely. It won’t be
displayed once the page is reloaded since Box stores a one-way hash of the
tokens instead of the actual token and cannot retrieve the original token again.
