<Accordion title="What are annotations?">

[Annotations][annotations] are markup notes on a file rendering and allow
developers to provide collaboration capabilities right from within the
embedded Box preview in their application.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="After uploading a file, how can my application get file representations?">

<Link href="/guides/representations">Box Representations</Link> let you get the digital assets
created for files stored in Box. You can use these endpoints to get PDF, text,
image, and thumbnail representations for a file.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I use Box View with storage providers other than Box?">

Currently, Box View is only compatible with files that are stored in Box. You
can delete the files from Box once you no longer need to display them. However,
you would need to re-upload them again in order to generate the preview.
For this reason, we recommend keeping the files stored in Box for at least as
long as you want to be able to display them.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I fix the CORS error Box gives me when I embed a Box UI Element?">

To fix the [CORS][cors] error, add each domain you wish to allow to make CORS
requests via the application's configuration page. Wildcards are supported for
the subdomain (`https://*.domain.com`). See the
<Link href="/guides/security/cors">CORS guide</Link> for more information.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How can I replace the Box logo that shows up on preview?">

See this guide for information on customizing the logo within a
<Link href="/guides/embed/ui-elements/logo">Preview UI Element</Link>.
