[Box AI Studio][ai-studio] allows you to build and manage custom AI agents to
best suit your business needs. For example, you can create an AI agent
that acts as a compliance consultant, answering questions regarding customer
documentation with the FedRAMP Moderate compliance in mind. 

## Box AI Studio capabilities

Currently, you can configure Box AI agent to answer user questions or generate
text you can use in your documents.

## Supported languages

{/* alex ignore */}

Box AI studio works in a number of languages including
English, Japanese, French, Spanish, and many more.
However, the underlying models are primarily
trained on English language documents. This means
that prompts in other languages may return answers
of lower quality than in English. Tests have shown
satisfactory results for summarizing, checking grammar
and spelling, and answering questions, but bear in mind
that the results may be different than in English.

Switch the language to Japanese to get
better results for this language.
