Programmatically harness the full functionality of the Box Sign web app
experience by leveraging Box Sign’s API endpoints to create, list, resend, and
cancel sign requests.

## Enablement

The following account types support requests through the Box Sign API:
Business, Business Plus, Enterprise, Enterprise Suites, Enterprise Plus, and
Enterprise Advanced.
To locate your account type, navigate to **Account Settings** and scroll down
to the **Account Details** section of the **Account** tab. For Admin details on
restricting access, please see our [support article][restrict].

## Required scopes

The following <Link href="/guides/api-calls/permissions-and-errors/scopes">scopes</Link> must be enabled for an application before use of
Box Sign's endpoints.

- <Link href="/guides/api-calls/permissions-and-errors/scopes/#read-all-files-and-folders">Read all files and folders stored in Box</Link>
- <Link href="/guides/api-calls/permissions-and-errors/scopes/#read-and-write-all-files-and-folders">Write all files and folders stored in Box</Link>
- <Link href="/guides/api-calls/permissions-and-errors/scopes/#manage-signature-requests">Manage signature requests</Link>

<Warning>
  Depending on the selected authentication method and enterprise's settings,
  your application may require Admin authorization or re-authorization before
  successful use of any newly selected scopes.

## Testing

Due to the feature parity, it may be useful to familiarize yourself with
[Box Sign functionality using the Box web app][webapp] before leveraging the
API. As with all API endpoints, we recommend testing via 
[developer sandbox environment][sandbox] to eliminate the risk of impacting
production content.
