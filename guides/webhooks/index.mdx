Webhooks allow you to monitor Box content for events, and receive notifications
to a URL of your choice when they occur. For example, a workflow may include
waiting for a file to be downloaded to delete a shared link. A webhook can be
set on the file and upon notification of the download event, a script can launch
to make an API call to delete the shared link.

## Versions

There are two types of webhooks: V1 and V2, which are compared below.

<Note>
  For the ease of use, better security, more event triggers to choose from,
  and automatic retries we recommend to use V2 webhooks.
