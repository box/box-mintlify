When an event triggers a webhook for a file or a folder, it makes a HTTP
call to the `address` specified when the webhook was created.
The payload of this call contains some request headers, and a JSON body.

## Payload headers

The payload sent by a webhook has the following Box-specific headers.

| Header                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `BOX-DELIVERY-ID`         | A unique ID assigned by Box that identifies the delivered webhook payload. When Box retries a webhook this ID will change, while the ID in the payload body remains the same. |
| `BOX-DELIVERY-TIMESTAMP`  | An RFC-3339 timestamp that identifies when the payload was sent.                                                                                                         |
| `BOX-SIGNATURE-PRIMARY`   | A <Link href="/guides/webhooks/v2/signatures-v2">signature</Link> created using the primary signature key configured for this webhook.                                                                                                     |
| `BOX-SIGNATURE-SECONDARY` | A <Link href="/guides/webhooks/v2/signatures-v2">signature</Link> created using the secondary signature key configured for this webhook.                                                                                                   |
| `BOX-SIGNATURE-VERSION`   | Value is always `1`.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `BOX-SIGNATURE-ALGORITHM` | Value is always `HmacSHA256` .                                                                                                                                                       |

For example:

```shell
BOX-DELIVERY-ID:          673a081b-bb4b-4d45-b4f1-4131a29c1d07
BOX-DELIVERY-TIMESTAMP:   2016-07-11T10:10:33-07:00
BOX-SIGNATURE-PRIMARY:    isCeDp7mLR41/MjcSEFLag9bWmpJkgmN80Je4VIESdo=
BOX-SIGNATURE-SECONDARY:  1UbiiKS7/2o5vNIlyMh7e5QGCHq8lflWFgEF+YWBugI=
BOX-SIGNATURE-VERSION:    1
BOX-SIGNATURE-ALGORITHM:  HmacSHA256
USER-AGENT:               Box-WH-Client/0.1
```

  of the webhook payloads.
</Note>

<Warning>
  HTTP header names are case insensitive. Your client should convert
  all header names to a standardized lowercase or uppercase format before trying
  to determine the value of a header.
</Warning>

## Payload body

The body of a webhook payload is a JSON object that describes the file or folder
(target) that triggered the webhook, as well as the event that has been
triggered.

| Field        | Description                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `type`       | Value is always `webhook_event`.                                                                                                                             |
| `id`         | A unique ID assigned by Box that identifies an event. When Box retries a webhook this ID will not change, while the ID in the header changes between calls. |
| `created_at` | The time/date when an event was triggered at.                                                                                                               |
| `trigger`    | The name of the action that triggered an event, for example `FILE.UPLOADED`.                                                                                 |
| `webhook`    | The webhook ID for which an event triggered.                                                                                                                  |
| `created_by` | The user that triggered an event.                                                                                                                          |
| `source`     | The item that triggered an event, for example the file that was uploaded to the target folder.                                                             |

## Retries

{/* alex ignore failed */}
Delivery of a webhook payload fails when Box does not receive a response with a
HTTP status code in the `200` to `299` range within 30 seconds of sending the
payload.

<Note>
  Box will retry webhook deliveries up to 12 times over a period of 2 hours.
  These numbers could be subject to change.
