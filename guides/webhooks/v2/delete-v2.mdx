You can delete a webhook using the [Developer Console][console] or API.

## Developer Console

To delete a webhook follow the steps below.

1. Navigate to the **Webhooks** tab in the [Developer Console][console].
2. Select the webhook you want to delete by clicking on its ID.
3. Click the **Delete** button.
4. Confirm the action by clicking **Delete** under the warning message.

## API

To remove a webhook from a file or folder, you need to use the
[remove webhook endpoint][delete] with the ID of the webhook. You can
get this value using the [list all webhooks endpoint][list].

<CodeGroup>
```sh cURL
curl -i -X DELETE "https://api.box.com/2.0/webhooks/3321123" \
     -H "authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>"
```

```typescript Node/TypeScript v10
await client.webhooks.deleteWebhookById(webhook.id!);
```

```python Python v10
client.webhooks.delete_webhook_by_id(webhook.id)
```

```csharp .NET v10
await client.Webhooks.DeleteWebhookByIdAsync(webhookId: NullableUtils.Unwrap(webhook.Id));
```

```swift Swift v10
try await client.webhooks.deleteWebhookById(webhookId: webhook.id!)
```

```java Java v10
client.getWebhooks().deleteWebhookById(webhook.getId())
```

```py Python v4
client.webhook(webhook_id='12345').delete()
print('The webhook was successfully deleted!')
```

```csharp .NET v6
await client.WebhooksManager.DeleteWebhookAsync("11111");
```

```js Node v4
client.webhooks.delete('1234')
 .then(() => {
  // deletion succeeded — no value returned
 });
```
</CodeGroup>

## Automatic webhook deletion

Using [this][delete] endpoint is not the only way a webhook can be deleted.

The following reasons can cause webhooks to be deleted.

- Deleting a Box application automatically deletes all webhooks associated with it.
- Deleting all active Access Tokens associated with a webhook automatically deletes the webhook. This includes Developer Tokens and password.
- The last successful notification was delivered 30 days ago to the set URL and the period between the last successful notification delivery and the last user trigger event date exceeds 14 days.

    Let's go through a scenario
    in which the user downloads a file. This action
    triggers the webhook to use the set URL to
    delete a shared link.
    The diagram illustrates this scenario, showing
    when the webhook will be deleted.

    </Frame>

    - **User event trigger**: when the user initiated the event, for example downloaded a file.
    - **Notification trigger**: when the notification was sent to the webhook, saying that the file was downloaded.
    - **Last notification delivery**: when the webhook sent a message to a specific URL, for example to delete a shared link.

In all of these cases Box sends a webhook payload with the
`WEBHOOK.DELETED` event name to the notification URL. The body of
the payload
includes the following additional information.

```json
"additional_info": {
  "reason": "auto_cleanup"
}
