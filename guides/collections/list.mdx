     -H "authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>"
```

```typescript Node/TypeScript v10
await client.collections.getCollections();
```

```python Python v10
client.collections.get_collections()
```

```cs .NET v10
await client.Collections.GetCollectionsAsync();
```

```swift Swift v10
try await client.collections.getCollections()
```

```java Java v5
Iterable<BoxCollection.Info> collections = BoxCollection.getAllCollections(api);
for (BoxCollection.Info collectionInfo : collections) {
	// Do something with the collection.
}
```

```python Python v4
collections = client.collections()
for collection in collections:
    print(f'Collection "{collection.name}" has ID {collection.id}')
```

```cs .NET v6
BoxCollection<BoxCollectionItem> collections = await client.CollectionsManager.GetCollectionsAsync();
```

```javascript Node v4
client.collections.getAll()
	.then(collections => {
		/* collections -> { total_count: 1,
			entries: 
			[ { type: 'collection',
				id: '11111',
				name: 'Favorites',
				collection_type: 'favorites' } ],
			limit: 100,

		*/
	});
```

<Warning>
  The only collection that is available via the API is the "Favorites"
  collection. The ID of this collection is different for every
  user.
</Warning>

## Favorites Collection

The only collection that can items can currently be added and removed to via the
API is the "Favorites" collection.

The ID of the favorites collection is different for every user. To find the
user's collection ID for their favorites, list all the user's collections and
then find the collection with a `collection_type` of `favorites`.

```json
{
  "entries": [
    {
      "collection_type": "favorites",
      "id": "12345678",
      "name": "Favorites",
      "type": "collection"
    }
  ],
  "limit": 100,
  "offset": 0,
  "total_count": 1
}
```
