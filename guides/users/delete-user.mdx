The process for deleting both app and managed users is the same. To delete a
user account, supply the user ID for the account that should be
removed.

<CodeGroup>

```sh cURL
curl -i -X DELETE "https://api.box.com/2.0/users/12345" \
     -H "authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>"
```

```typescript Node/TypeScript v10
await client.users.deleteUserById(user.id);
```

```python Python v10
client.users.delete_user_by_id(user.id)
```

```cs .NET v10
await client.Users.DeleteUserByIdAsync(userId: user.Id);
```

```swift Swift v10
try await client.users.deleteUserById(userId: user.id)
```

```java Java v10
client.getUsers().deleteUserById(user.getId())
```

```java Java v5
BoxUser user = new BoxUser(api, "0");
user.delete(false, false);
```

```python Python v4
user_id = '33333'
client.user(user_id).delete(force=True)
```

```cs .NET v6
await client.UsersManager.DeleteEnterpriseUserAsync("44444", notify: false, force: true);
```

```javascript Node v4
// Delete the user even if they still have files in their account
client.users.delete('123', {force: true})
    .then(() => {
        // deletion succeeded — no value returned
    });
```

</CodeGroup>

There are also two optional parameters that may be set when deleting a user
account:

* force: Whether the user should be deleted even if the account still has content in it.
* notify: Whether the user will receive a notification that the account was deleted.

<Note>
  The delete user request will fail if the user account still has content in
  it. To resolve this, either
  <Link href="/guides/users/deprovision/transfer-folders">transfer all files or folders</Link>
  to another account or use the optional `force` parameter.
