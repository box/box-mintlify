As part of user account deprovisioning, a common requirement is to transfer all
files and folders that are stored within the user account to another user
account or into a location for long term storage, such as into the service
account.

There are two general methods that are employed to accomplish this within Box:

* Using the direct [transfer owned folders](/reference/put-users-id-folders-0) API, which will move all content from one user directly to another.
* Using the collaboration transfer method to change ownership of one file or folder at a time from one user to another.

<Note>
  Files owned by a user will be inaccessible while they are being transferred.
  This also means that any shared content owned by the user may be inaccessible
  during the move.

  Depending on the volume of content, this operation may take a significant
  amount of time.
</Note>

## Transfer Owned Folders API Method

The [transfer owned folders endpoint](/reference/put-users-id-folders-0) is
designed to move the entirety of content owned by one user over to another user.

<Note>
  The transfer owned folders API is performed as a synchronous process, which
  might lead to a slow response when the source user has a large number of
  items in all of its folders.
</Note>

To call the transfer endpoint, you will supply the user ID to transfer from and
the user ID to transfer to.

## Collaboration Transfer Method

The collaboration transfer method is a process that uses the
[collaboration endpoint](/reference/post-collaborations) to change the
ownership of a single file or folder from one user to another instantaneously.

<Note>
  This method will perform an instantaneous transfer of ownership of a single
  file or folder, but **cannot** be used to transfer the root (all files and
  folders) from one user to another.
</Note>

The general process, between `transfer_from_user` to `transfer_to_user`, will
follow these steps:

### Add Transfer To User as Co-Owner

The first step is to add the `transfer_to_user` account as a collaborator with
`co-owner` access on the file or folder that should be transferred.

Making the call as the `transfer_from_user` account, add the `transfer_to_user`
as a co-owner using the
[add collaboration endpoint](/reference/post-collaborations).

```sh cURL
curl -i -X POST "https://api.box.com/2.0/collaborations" \
     -H "authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>" \
     -H "content-type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "item": {
         "type": "file",
         "id": "11446498"
       },
       "accessible_by": {
         "type": "user",
         "login": "user@example.com"
       },
       "role": "editor"
     }'
```

```typescript Node/TypeScript v10
await client.userCollaborations.createCollaboration({
  item: {
    type: 'folder' as CreateCollaborationRequestBodyItemTypeField,
    id: folder.id,
  } satisfies CreateCollaborationRequestBodyItemField,
  accessibleBy: {
    type: 'user' as CreateCollaborationRequestBodyAccessibleByTypeField,
    id: user.id,
  } satisfies CreateCollaborationRequestBodyAccessibleByField,
  role: 'editor' as CreateCollaborationRequestBodyRoleField,
} satisfies CreateCollaborationRequestBody);
```

```python Python v10
client.user_collaborations.create_collaboration(
    CreateCollaborationItem(type=CreateCollaborationItemTypeField.FOLDER, id=folder.id),
    CreateCollaborationAccessibleBy(
        type=CreateCollaborationAccessibleByTypeField.USER, id=user.id
    ),
    CreateCollaborationRole.EDITOR,
)
```

```cs .NET v10
await client.UserCollaborations.CreateCollaborationAsync(requestBody: new CreateCollaborationRequestBody(item: new CreateCollaborationRequestBodyItemField() { Type = CreateCollaborationRequestBodyItemTypeField.Folder, Id = folder.Id }, accessibleBy: new CreateCollaborationRequestBodyAccessibleByField(type: CreateCollaborationRequestBodyAccessibleByTypeField.User) { Id = user.Id }, role: CreateCollaborationRequestBodyRoleField.Editor));
```

```swift Swift v10
try await client.userCollaborations.createCollaboration(requestBody: CreateCollaborationRequestBody(item: CreateCollaborationRequestBodyItemField(type: CreateCollaborationRequestBodyItemTypeField.folder, id: folder.id), accessibleBy: CreateCollaborationRequestBodyAccessibleByField(type: CreateCollaborationRequestBodyAccessibleByTypeField.user, id: user.id), role: CreateCollaborationRequestBodyRoleField.editor))
```

```java Java v10
client.getUserCollaborations().createCollaboration(new CreateCollaborationRequestBody(new CreateCollaborationRequestBodyItemField.Builder().type(CreateCollaborationRequestBodyItemTypeField.FOLDER).id(folder.getId()).build(), new CreateCollaborationRequestBodyAccessibleByField.Builder(CreateCollaborationRequestBodyAccessibleByTypeField.USER).id(user.getId()).build(), CreateCollaborationRequestBodyRoleField.EDITOR))
```

```java Java v5
BoxCollaborator user = new BoxUser(api, "user-id")
BoxFolder folder = new BoxFolder(api, "folder-id");
folder.collaborate(user, BoxCollaboration.Role.EDITOR);
```

```python Python v4
from boxsdk.object.collaboration import CollaborationRole

user = client.user(user_id='11111')
collaboration = client.folder(folder_id='22222').collaborate(user, CollaborationRole.VIEWER)

collaborator = collaboration.accessible_by
item = collaboration.item
has_accepted = 'has' if collaboration.status == 'accepted' else 'has not'
print(f'{collaborator.name} {has_accepted} accepted the collaboration to folder "{item.name}"')
```

```cs .NET v6
// collaborate folder 11111 with user 22222
BoxCollaborationRequest requestParams = new BoxCollaborationRequest()
{
    Item = new BoxRequestEntity()
    {
        Type = BoxType.folder,
        Id = "11111"
    },
    Role = "editor",
    AccessibleBy = new BoxCollaborationUserRequest()
    {
        Type = BoxType.user,
        Id = "22222"
    }
};
BoxCollaboration collab = await client.CollaborationsManager.AddCollaborationAsync(requestParams);
```

```javascript Node v4
// Invite user 123456 to collaborate on folder 987654
client.collaborations.createWithUserID('123456', '987654', client.collaborationRoles.EDITOR)
	.then(collaboration => {
		/* collaboration -> {
			type: 'collaboration',
			id: '11111',
			created_by: 
			{ type: 'user',
				id: '22222',
				name: 'Inviting User',
				login: 'inviter@example.com' },
			created_at: '2016-11-16T21:33:31-08:00',

			status: 'accepted',
			accessible_by: 
			{ type: 'user',

				login: 'collaborator@example.com' },
			role: 'editor',

			item: 
			{ type: 'folder',
				id: '987654',
				sequence_id: '0',
				etag: '0',
				name: 'Collaborated Folder' } }
		*/
	});
```

### Fetch Collaboration ID as Transfer To User

The next step is make a request to get the collaboration information, making
the request as the `transfer_to_user` account. The collaboration object
returned will include a collaboration ID, which is used for the last step.

Making the call as the `transfer_to_user` account, get the collaboration on the
file or folder ID being transferred, using the
[get collaboration endpoint](/reference/get-collaborations-id). Capture the
collaboration ID.

<Sample id='get_collaborations_id' />

### Remove Transfer From User as Owner

The final step is to remove the `transfer_from_user` account as an owner of the
file or folder, which is accomplished using the
[delete collaboration endpoint](/reference/delete-collaborations-id).

Making call as the `transfer_to_user` account, remove the `transfer_from_user`
as a collaborator on the file or folder.

<Sample id='delete_collaborations_id' />

The file or folder is now owned by the `transfer_to_user` account, and the
`transfer_from_user` account no longer has access.
