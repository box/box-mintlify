Data extraction can be challenging because source content varies widely with different layouts, templates, and file types. The Box AI Extract API provides two AI-powered endpoints: structured extraction and freeform extraction that standardize how you extract metadata from files in Box. With these endpoints, you can:

- Extract specific fields into a consistent schema or Box metadata template (structured extraction).
- Leverage enhanced extraction for more complex use cases and improved accuracy powered by advanced AI models (structured extraction).
- Extract content when the target fields are not known ahead of time (freeform extraction).
- Run extractions without building your own orchestration, permission checks, or throttling logic around the extraction workflow.
- Extract data from documents in various languages, file formats, scanned documents, or photos.

To explore the possibilities of these endpoints, discover the following use cases in various industries:

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="Sales & finance operations">
        **Recommended endpoint:** structured metadata extraction (`POST /2.0/ai/extract_structured`)
        
        Ideal for high-volume, standardized documents where you need predictable data types:

        - **Automated data entry:** Structured metadata extraction ensures consistent JSON response every time thanks to a preconfigured metadata template.
        - **Invoices and purchase orders:** Extract line items, totals, and dates.
        - **Client contracts:** Parse standardized fields like "Effective Date" or "Total Contract Value" to update CRM records.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Legal & HR">
        **Recommended endpoint:** freeform metadata extraction (`POST /2.0/ai/extract`)
        
        Ideal for queries where document structure is not known ahead of time or varies:

        - **HR onboarding:** Extract key personal details from diverse offer letters or candidate resumes.
        - **NDA clauses:** Extract specific NDA clauses from legal documents.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Industry-specific solutions">
        Use advanced features like Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and enhanced extraction agent for regulated sectors:
        <AccordionGroup>
            <Accordion title="Financial services">
                - **Know Your Customer (KYC) documents:** Verify user’s identity by extracting text from scanned passports or driver's licenses.
                - **Loan origination:** Automate income verification by pulling data from scanned utility bills or pay stubs.
            </Accordion>

            <Accordion title="Life Sciences">
                - **Clinical Trial Enrollment:** Extract patient criteria from medical forms to match candidates with trials.
                - **Regulatory submissions:** Organize and validate the data required for submissions such as FDA or EMA.
            </Accordion>

            <Accordion title="Public Sector">
                - **Permit applications:** Accelerate zoning approvals by validating required documentation.
                - **Public records requests:** Automatically classify and prioritize documents for public requests such as Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).
            </Accordion>
        </AccordionGroup>
    </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Core benefits of using the Box AI Extract API

- **Managed scaling:** The Box AI Extract API is designed to handle queues and rate limits, so you can run high-volume processing.
- **No defensive code:** The Box AI Extract API is model-agnostic, which enables switching between supported LLMs with minimal code changes and minimizing vendor lock-in.
- **Security and compliance:** All extracted data inherits the enterprise-grade security and governance policies of the Box platform.
