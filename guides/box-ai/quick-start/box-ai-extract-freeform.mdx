---

[Box AI](/ai-dev-zone) exposes intelligent extraction capabilities that enable developers to automatically extract
key-value pairs from documents through a single API call. This powerful feature transforms unstructured
document content into actionable metadata without manual data entry, streamlining document processing
workflows for invoices, forms, contracts, and other business documents.

This quick start demonstrates how to configure the Box Python SDK and use Box AI to extract data from a W-2 stored in Box.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create and configure a Box application">
    The first step for any Box Platform integration is to create and configure a Box 
    application. 
    1. Go to [Box Developer Console](https://app.box.com/developers/console).
    2. For this quick start, create an App with the `Client Credentials Grant` 
    application type. 
    3. Once the app is created, enable the following scopes:
        * `Read all files and folders stored in Box`
        * `Write all files and folders stored in Box`
        * `Manage AI`

    For more information about creating a new Box application, see [Create your first application](/guides/getting-started/first-application#create-your-first-application).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Upload a test file">
    After preparing the template, select a file to test. For this quick start, use this
    [sample W-2](/static/quickstarts/extract/files/freeform-extract-file.pdf).

1. Download the test document, and then drag and drop it into your Box account.
2. Get the file ID by opening the file in Box and inspecting the URL.
The last part of the path is your file ID. For example, the URL might look like this:
    `https://app.box.com/file/2064123286902`
    
    In this case, the file ID is `2064123286902`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure the environment">
    Now set up your development environment to run the extraction. For this quick start, use Python and the 
    Box Python SDK version 10. Make sure you have Python 3.11 or higher installed on your machine.
    1. Create a new directory for your project and navigate into it.
    2. Create a virtual environment:
       ```bash
       python3 -m venv .venv
       source .venv/bin/activate
       ```
    3. Install the Box Python SDK:
       ```bash
       pip install "boxsdk~=10"
       ```
    4. Install the `python-dotenv` package to load environment variables from the `.env` file:
       ```bash
       pip install python-dotenv
       ```
    5. Create an `.env` file in the root of your project directory and add the following 
    environment variables, replacing the placeholder values with your actual Box app credentials
    and the IDs from the previous steps:
       ```bash
        BOX_DEVELOPER_TOKEN=your_box_developer_token

        BOX_METADATA_TEMPLATE_KEY=your_metadata_template_key
        BOX_FILE_ID=your_box_file_id
       ```
    
    To get your developer token, go to the Box Developer Console, open your app, and navigate to 
    the **Configuration** tab. 
    
    6. Click **Generate Developer Token** to create a new token.  

    <Tip>
      For simplicity, this quick start uses a short-lived developer token. In production, you 
      should authenticate using your app’s configured method (for example, Client Credentials Grant) 
      instead of a developer token.
    </Tip>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Create the freeform-extract.py file">
    Your development environment is now ready to create the Python script to extract data from the document using Box AI. 
    
1. Create a new file named `freeform-extract.py` in the root of your project directory and add the following code:

    ```python
    import os

    from dotenv import load_dotenv

    from box_sdk_gen import (
        AiItemBase,
        BoxClient,
        BoxDeveloperTokenAuth
    )

    # Set up environment variables
    load_dotenv()

    developer_token = os.getenv("BOX_DEVELOPER_TOKEN")
    file_id = os.getenv("BOX_FILE_ID")

    def get_box_client(token: str) -> BoxClient:
        
        if not developer_token:
            raise ValueError("BOX_DEVELOPER_TOKEN is not set in environment variables.")
        
        auth = BoxDeveloperTokenAuth(token=token)
        client = BoxClient(auth=auth)

        return client

    def main():
        client = get_box_client(token=developer_token)

        # Get the current user and print the ID to validate the client is working
        me = client.users.get_user_me()
        print(f"My user ID is {me.id}")

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

    This code loads the environment variables from the `.env` file, initializes the Box SDK client, 
    and prints the current user's ID to validate that the client is working correctly.

2. Run the script using the following command in your terminal:

    ```bash
    python freeform-extract.py
    ```

    If the Box SDK client is set up correctly, the console displays your user ID. For example:

    ```bash
    My user ID is 123456789
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Extract data">
    With a working Box SDK client, you can add the code to extract data from the document using Box AI.

1. Between the `get_box_client` function and the `main` function, add the following function:

    ```python
    def extract_metadata(client: BoxClient, file_id: str) -> str:

        prompt = """
        firstName, lastName, wages, federalTaxWithheld, 
        socialSecurityWages, socialSecurityTaxWithheld, 
        medicareWagesAndTips, medicareTaxWithheld, 
        stateWages, stateTaxWithheld, 
        localWagesAndTips, localTaxWithheld
        """

        metadata = client.ai.create_ai_extract(
            prompt,
            [AiItemBase(id=file_id)]
        )
        
        return metadata.to_dict()['answer']
    ```

    This function uses the Box AI `create_ai_extract` method to extract metadata from the specified file.
    Your BoxClient and the file ID are sent to the function, which returns the extracted metadata as a dictionary.

2. Add the function call to extract the metadata in the `main` function. Ensure that the new `main` function contains the following logic: 

    ```python
    def main():
        client = get_box_client(token=developer_token)

        me = client.users.get_user_me()
        print(f"My user ID is {me.id}")

        metadata = extract_metadata(client=client, file_id=file_id)

        print(f"\n\nExtracted Metadata: {metadata}")
    ```

    The SDK handles the API call to Box AI and returns the extracted metadata as an
    [`AiExtractResponse`](/reference/resources/ai-extract-response) object. In this quick start,
    the code converts this object to a dictionary and returns the `answer` field that contains the extracted
    key/value pairs.


3. Print out the extracted metadata to the console to verify that the extraction was successful by running the following command in your terminal:


    ```bash
    python freeform-extract.py
    ```

    If the extraction was successful, the console displays your user ID followed by the extracted metadata from the W-2.

    ```bash
    My user ID is 123456789

    Extracted Metadata: {"firstName": "Wayne", "lastName": "Gatsby", "wages": "355000", "federalTaxWithheld": "125600", "socialSecurityWages": "355000", "socialSecurityTaxWithheld": "12300", "medicareWagesAndTips": "355000", "medicareTaxWithheld": "13200", "stateWages": "355,000", "stateTaxWithheld": "15000", "localWagesAndTips": "355000", "localTaxWithheld": "8000"}
    ```
  </Step>
