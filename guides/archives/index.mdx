<Note>
Box Archive is available only for Enterprise Advanced accounts.
</Note>

Box Archive allows you to create and manage archives. An archive is a folder dedicated to
storing content that is redundant, outdated, or trivial. Content in an archive is owned by the enterprise,
and it is not accessible to previous owner and collaborators.

## Archives are folders

Archives are a special type of folders. Box Archive APIs allow you to create, list, update and delete archives.
However, there are other APIs that also work with archives or with content within archives.
For a full list of supported APIs, see the <Link href="/guides/archives/supported-apis">Supported APIs</Link> guide.

{/* Before using any of the Box Archive APIs, make sure you can access Box Archive in Admin Console. Your Box Platform app must have the GCM and Read and write all files and folders scopes enabled. If you plan to only view archives and not modify them, use the Read all files and folders instead of the Read and write all files and folders scope. */}

## Required scopes

Before using any of the Box Archive APIs, make sure you can access [Box Archive in Admin Console][Box Archive in Admin Console].
Your Box Platform app must have the `GCM` and `Read and write all files and folders` <Link href="/guides/api-calls/permissions-and-errors/scopes/">scopes</Link> enabled.
If you plan to only view archives and not modify them, use the `Read all files and folders` instead of the `Read and write all files and folders` scope. 
Additionally, to be able to assign <Link href="/reference/resources/storage-policy/">storage policy</Link> to an archive during its creation, your enterprise must have access to the Box Zones feature and your app must have the `Manage users` scope.

<Note>
The `GCM` scope is not available in the Developer Console and needs to be enabled by contacting customer support.
