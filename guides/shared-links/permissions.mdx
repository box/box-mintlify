import {RelatedLinks, MultiRelatedLinks} from "/snippets/related-links.jsx";

The shared link resource has three permissions that can be updated using the
`permissions` field: `can_preview`, `can_download`, `can_edit`.

<Warning>
  The `can_edit` option can only be `true` for files. Also, if the admin has
  restricted shared links from having edit access in the admin console, you
  will not be able to set `can_edit` to `true`.
</Warning>

```sh
curl -i -X PUT 'https://api.box.com/2.0/files/123456789?fields=shared_link' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer [ACCESS TOKEN]' \
    -d '{
      "shared_link": {
        "permissions": {
          "can_preview": true,
          "can_download": true,
          "can_edit": true
        }
      }
    }'
