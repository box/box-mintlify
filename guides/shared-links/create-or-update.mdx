Shared links may be created or directly for file, folder, or web link
resources to generate a read-only URL to permit users with the appropriate
access level to view the content.

<Note>
  You may only have one active shared link for a file, folder, or web link at
  any time.
</Note>

At minimum the information needed to create a shared link will be:

* The type of resource, either a file, folder, or web link.
* The ID of that resource.

Optionally when creating a shared link the following may be specified:

* The access level, which may be one of:
    * open: A public shared link. Anyone with the link may access the link.
    * company: Anyone within your enterprise may access the link.
    * collaborators: Anyone collaborated on the content may access the link.
* An expiration time when the shared link will automatically disable.
* A password required to access the resource.

<Note>
  If an access level is not specified when creating a shared link it will use
  the default access level specified by the enterprise admin.
