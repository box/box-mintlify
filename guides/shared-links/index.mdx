Shared links are URLs that are generated for files, folders, web links stored
in Box, which provide direct, read-only access to the resource.

Shared links which are set to an open access level allow anyone with the URL to
access the item, while shared links with company or collaborators access levels
may only be accessed by appropriate authenticated Box users. See
[here][community_create_shared_link] for all of the options and admin settings
related to shared links.

Users can access shared items by entering the shared link URL in a browser.
Applications can also access shared items using the
<Link href="/reference/get-shared-items">Shared Item API</Link>.
