<Update label={<span>New annotations in the Content Preview UI Element</span>} description="2022-10-19" tags={["New features", "Impactful changes", "API"]}>
  To improve the content previewing experience, we have added support for new
annotations types in the Preview UI Element.
End users previewing content in custom applications can now utilize additional
annotation types, such as text highlight, drawing, and more. All the annotations
sync in real time.

## Where to get support
