<Update label="2023-03-28" tags={["New features", "API"]}>
## Collaborations API - pending status
  We added more information about the `pending` status in our [collaborations API][1].

If the collaboration is in [`pending` status][2]:

- login and name return an empty string,
- the following fields are redacted:
    - `login` and `name` are hidden if a collaboration was created using `user_id`,
    - `name` is hidden if a collaboration was created using `login`.

## Where to get support

Should you have any issues or need further guidance, please post a request to
our [developer forum][3] for any help needed.
