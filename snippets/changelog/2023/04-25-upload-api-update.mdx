## Updates to File Upload API
  In response to a potential security vulnerability while uploading a file using [Upload File API][1] and downscoped token,
we’re updating the Upload File API to return a 404 error in scenarios where the parent Folder ID is found, but the requester does not have permissions to access it.

# Where to get support

Should you have any issues or need further guidance, please post a request to our [developer forum][2] for any help needed.
