<Update label="2023-04-20" description="Updates to Box Embed guide" tags={["API"]}>
  With [Box Embed][1] you can embed a Box webapp anywhere in your application. The updated webapp is responsive to any changes. For example, if an integration makes the embedded Box webapp smaller, all the UI components such as buttons and lists will also be resized to still be usable.

The update also includes a description of the cloud game, a widget which increases security by preventing clickjacking.
