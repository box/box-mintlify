<Update label="2023-06-26" description="Integration mappings for Slack" tags={["New features", "API"]}>
  Learn how the Box Enterprise Admin (EA) can customize the upload folder of the Slack channel to any folder
within the enterprise instead of relying on the default one with the [Integration Mappings for Slack][1] guide.

Use Box API to [create][2], [list][3], [update][4], and [delete][5] the Slack Integration Mappings. 

Using the [automation script][9], an admin can create or update multiple mappings at once!

Check the [Troubleshooting][6] section to find out solutions to most common issues you can encounter.

## New place to get support

From now on you can ask questions and seek for guidance in our new [Box Developer Community forum][8]. Use this new space to directly speak to the Box Developer Relations team, as well as your peers and other subject matter experts from Box.
