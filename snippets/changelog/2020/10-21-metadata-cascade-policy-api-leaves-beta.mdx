<Update label={<span>Metadata Cascade Policies API leaves Beta</span>} description="2020-10-21" tags={["API"]}>
  The [Metadata Cascade Policies API][mdc_api] is now generally available to all
and no longer in Beta.

Over the past years, we've made a lot of technical improvements to our metadata
infrastructure and we're happy to announce that we've now gotten to the moment
where the Metadata Cascade Policies API is leaving Beta. This release does not
involve any breaking changes and any existing application should not see any
impact from this release.

Since we initially launched, Metadata Cascade Policies has become over 10 times
faster when applying metadata to new instances. Additionally, we've also made
significant strides in reliability and observability to ensure a top-notch API
experience, in line with the rest of our API suite.

For more details about metadata, and metadata cascade policies, please visit the
[Metadata guides][guides] and our dedicated [Metadata Cascade Policies][mdc_api]
reference documentation.
