## Group API adds new filter and permissions
  The [`GET /groups`](/reference/get-groups) API now supports
filtering groups by name using a new `filter_term` field.

```curl
curl -i -X GET "https://api.box.com/2.0/groups?filter_term=Engineering" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>"
```

Additionally, all the Group endpoints now allow a developer to request
a new
[`permissions`](/reference/resources/group--full/#param-permissions)
field, which currently has one attribute defining
if the authenticated user can invite the group to any item.

```curl
curl -i -X GET "https://api.box.com/2.0/groups?field=permissions" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>"
```
```json
{
    "total_count": 1,
    "entries": [
        {
            "type": "group",
            "id": "223353242",
            "permissions": {
                "can_invite_as_collaborator": true
            }
        }
    ],
    "limit": 100,
    "offset": 0
}
```
