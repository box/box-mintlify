<Update label="2020-07-16" description="Change to enterprise events for content access" tags={["New features", "API"]}>
  Starting today, the [enterprise event stream](/guides/events/enterprise-events/for-enterprise/) will
begin producing new content access events.

A new `CONTENT_ACCESS` event is triggered when a file was accessed by an
authorized user or programmatically by a Box application. 

See the [enterprise events](/guides/events/enterprise-events/for-enterprise/) documentation
for more information on other event types.
