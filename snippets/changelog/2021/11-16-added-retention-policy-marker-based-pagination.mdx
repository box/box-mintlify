  [`GET /retention-policies`](/reference/get-retention-policies) and
  [`GET /retention-policies-id-assignments`](/reference/get-retention-policies-id-assignments)
  endpoints.
* Added `limit` and `next_marker ` to the response object for
  [retention policies](/reference/resources/retention-policies) and
  [retention policy assignments](/reference/resources/retention-policy-assignments)
