<Update label="2021-11-03" tags={["New features", "API"]}>
## Extend Retention Via Files API
  Now, you can extend the retention date for a file that is already under
retention using the new `disposition_at` field. If the date is extended, it
cannot be reverted or updated to a date prior to the new date.
