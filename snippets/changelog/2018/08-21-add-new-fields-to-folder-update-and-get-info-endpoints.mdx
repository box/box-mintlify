<Update label={<span>Add new fields to folder update and get info endpoints</span>} description="2018-08-21" tags={["新機能", "API"]}>
  Two major releases have been added to the [update folder API endpoint](endpoint://put-folders-id),
`is_collaboration_restricted_to_enterprise`. This is a boolean value made to
set whether future collaborations should be restricted to within the enterprise
only. This does not affect existing collaborations. The value of this field
will also be displayed when calling the [get folder info endpoint](endpoint://get-folders-id).
