<Update label="2019-12-05" description="Marker-based Pagination Support for Users API" tags={["New features", "API"]}>
  The [Users API](/reference/get_users) now supports [marker-based
pagination](g://api-calls/pagination/marker-based). Marker-based pagination is
an alternative to regular offset-based pagination and provides an alternative
way to get users for enterprises with a large volume of users.
