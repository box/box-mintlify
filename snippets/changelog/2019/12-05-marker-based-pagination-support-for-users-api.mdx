## Marker-based Pagination Support for Users API
  The [Users API](/reference/get_users) now supports [marker-based
pagination](/guides/api-calls/pagination/marker-based). Marker-based pagination is
an alternative to regular offset-based pagination and provides an alternative
way to get users for enterprises with a large volume of users.
