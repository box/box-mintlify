<Update label={<span>New fields for File Versions</span>} description="2019-10-25" tags={["New features", "API"]}>
  New optional fields have been made available within the File Version object,
namely `trashed_by`, `restored_by` and `restored_at`.

The fields will be returned as part of the standard
[File Version object](endpoint://resources/file-version/).

The purpose of these fields is to have a better understanding of when file
versions have been moved in and out of the trash, and by whom.
