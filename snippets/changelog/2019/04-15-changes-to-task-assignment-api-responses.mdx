## Changes to Task (Assignment) API responses

  We have released an update to the API responses of the
[Get Task](/reference/get-tasks-id) and
[Get Task Assignment](/reference/get-task-assignments-id) endpoints.

Prior to this change, if a call was made to get a task or task assignment with
a valid task ID, and that file was deleted or your permissions changed to
prevent viewing the file, you would receive a 404 error because the tasks would
be deleted with the file.

With this new change, the response returned will be the task object with a
`null` response where the item would be, rather than a 404 error response.
