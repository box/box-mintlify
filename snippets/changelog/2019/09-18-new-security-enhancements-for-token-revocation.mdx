<Update label="2019-09-18" description="New security enhancements for token revocation" tags={["New features", "API"]}>
  We have enhanced the capabilities of the [token
revocation](/reference/post-oauth2-revoke/) endpoint to permit
[downscoped tokens][downscope] to be
revoked prior to their expiration time. Previous to this update only fully
scoped access tokens could be revoked through the /revoke endpoint. With this
new enhancement downscoped tokens may now be revoked in addition to the fully
scoped access tokens.

More information is available [here][blog_token_revocation].
