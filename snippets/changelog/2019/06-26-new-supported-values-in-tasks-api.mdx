<Update label="2019-06-26" description="New supported values in Tasks API" tags={["API"]}>
  On June 26th, Box released support for a new task type, general tasks. When
creating or updating a task, the `action` field can either be `review` for
approval tasks or `complete` for the new general tasks.

This change also affects the accepted values when updating a task assignment.
If you want to update an approval/review task, the `resolution_state` can be
set to `incomplete`, `approved`, or `rejected`. A general/complete task can
have a `resolution_state` of `incomplete` or `completed`.

The Tasks API doesn't refer to tasks as "General" or "Approval" within the
response body. This is reflected only within Box's UI.

Docs can be found [here](/reference/resources/task/).
