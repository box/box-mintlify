## New developer documentation site (beta)

We are excited to announce the beta launch of the new Box developer documentation site. This release provides access to the redesigned, AI-first, purpose-built developer experience platform.

## What’s included in this launch

New design aligned with developer workflows:

* Refreshed homepage
* Intuitive landing pages
* Interactive API testing experience
* Improved readability and accessibility:
    * Enhanced navigation
    * Clear, responsive book structure with global and single-page tables of contents
    * Light and dark modes

AI-first functionality:

* AI-powered search with generative answers and aggregated results from across Box sites
* Contextual menu options to integrate with leading AI tools and copy pages as Markdown
* Box Dev Docs MCP server

## Developer impact

The new site delivers our up-to-date developer documentation in an entirely new experience. Some UX features are still in their beta shape and will continue to be refined in the next few weeks, so you may encounter occasional changes or improvements as we gather feedback and iterate. We encourage you to engage with the new functionality and share your comments.
